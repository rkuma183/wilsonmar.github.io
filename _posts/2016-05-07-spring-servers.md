"Spring" is a brand name for a <a href="#Suite">suite</a> of web server products
from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pivotal.com/">
Pivotal.com</a> (now a division of VMWare).

This tutorial presents a **hands-on** introduction with commentary along the way
with facts and wisdom from <a href="#References">several sources</a>.

> The approach of this tutorial is to get you a working server so that
you can see the impact of your changes to sample code, in the context of all modules
and tools you use.

A lot of time has been spent to sequence the presentation.


<a name="Suite"></a>

## The Pivotal suite

The <strong>Spring Framework</strong> 
manages dependency injection (aka Inversion of Control)
to make application code "loosely coupled" and thus be tested easier.

<strong>Spring Boot</strong> address competitors to Spring (such as 
Node using JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, Python, and Go), which
use RESTful API web services 
exchanging JSON-formatted files rather than SOAP and XML.

Spring Boot makes use of <strong>Spring MVC</strong> (Model View Controller)
programming pattern
for its UI handling (core, beans, context, AOP).

"Beans" are units of work within a server. It is a concept from the framework
Java Enterprise Edition (JEE), previously called J2EE.
This "object oriented programming" approach is considered a "heavyweight" framework
that sprung up during the 1990's. So it can be viewed as both "mature" and "bloated".

## Eclipse STS IDE #

There is no Homebrew module for Mac.

0. Use a modern internet browser to the STS website.
0. Select a download site to begin download. Wait for the file to download.
0. Unzip
0. In Finder, navigate inside the folder, such as:

   ~/Documents/workspace-sts-3.8.0.RELEASE

   This contains the server.

0. Move and/or rename the folder according to your organization's standards.

0. In Finder navigate to /Applications.
0. Move (drag and drop) STS.app to /Applications.
0. Open STS by double-clicking the icon.
0. Click Open icon for first-time confirmation.
0. Specify your workspace.

advises on the use of STS 


## STS (Spring Tools Suite) #

<a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/spring-tool-suite-sts-eclipse">
Included with STS</a> (Spring Tools Suite)
is the developer edition of Pivotal <strong>tc</strong> Server, 
the drop-in replacement for Apache Tomcat thatâ€™s optimized for Spring.

The Spring Insight console, tc Server Developer Edition, 
provides a graphical real-time view of application performance metrics that lets developers identify and diagnose problems from their desktops.



## Sample Project

https://github.com/pivotal-enablement/articulate
is the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Elastic Runtime Service basic demo.


## Install

There are several ways:

   1. In a cloud. Pivotal sells time on their 
   Cloud Foundry hosting platform
   so developers can write "cloud native" applications.
   2. QUESTION: Local Docker image?
   3. Local from package (Homebrew on Macs)
   4. Local from direct downloads

Cloud Foundry provides a CLI that enables a level of abstraction to enable one to 
switch from Amazon Web Services to Azure or Google or IBM.

Actions to get started:

   0. <a href="#EclipseSTS">Spring Tools Suite (STS) edition of the Eclipse IDE</a>
   0. <a href="#SampleCode">Get Sample Code</a>
   0. <a href="#LocalInstall">Local install</a>
   0. <a href="#Maven">Build using Maven</a>

## Sample Project

0. In an internet browser, go to this URL and fork the repo:

   https://github.com/pivotal-enablement/articulate

   This is the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Elastic Runtime Service basic demo.

   Notice among the files is a pom.xml file used by Maven.

0. In Jenkins, create job "articulate-dnr"

## Spring Boot

Actuator : Enables Advanced Monitoring and Tracing of applications.




## Help and Support

The software is open sourced, but Pivotal provides services.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.springOnePlatform.io">
SpringOnePlatform.io</a> is Pivotal's annual conference (#springone, @s1p) 
on December 4, 2017
at the Moscone Center, near Pivotal's San Francisco office.

## Install Predix #

See https://www.predix.io/resources/tutorials/tutorial-details.html?tutorial_id=1523

0. Create a folder (~/gits/predix) to hold repos and cd to it.

   Predix offers two samples:

   * git clone https://github.com/PredixDev/predix-microservice-cf-jsr.git
   * git clone https://github.com/PredixDev/predix-microservice-cf-spring.git

0. Create repo for JSR and cd into it:

   <tt><strong>
   git clone https://github.com/PredixDev/predix-microservice-cf-jsr.git<br />
   cd predix-microservice-cf-jsr
   </strong></tt>

   The tree of folders and files for JSR is more complex than Spring:

   <pre>
|-- COPYRIGHT.md
|-- LICENSE.md
|-- README.md
|-- config
|   `-- application.properties
|-- manifest.yml
|-- pom.xml
`-- src
    |-- main
    |   |   `-- com
   </pre>


<a name="Maven"></a>

## Build using Maven #

   <tt><strong>mvn clean package 
   </strong></tt>

   The end of a long list is like this:

   <pre>
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time: 02:27 min
[INFO] Finished at: 2016-07-08T08:55:47-06:00
[INFO] Final Memory: 30M/152M
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   </pre>

   See Maven video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CFWeVgzsqY


<a name="SpringModules"></a>

## Spring Modules #

* Spring JDBC (Java Data Base) for SQL data
* Spring MVC
* Spring AOP
* Spring ORM
* Spring JMS
* Spring Test
* Spring Security for Authentication and Authorization

Spring enables easier integration with other frameworks:

* Hibernate for ORM
* iBatis for Object Mapping
* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5k9NOR9lrI">
   JUnit</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2KwvXQgQx4">
   Mockito</a> for Unit Testing

### Auto configuration

Spring Boot looks at the operating system CLASSPATH containing paths to folders of 
Java libraries to do auto-configuration.

* Jackson Databind for JSON data binding
* Log4j for logging logback, slf4j
* Tomcat embedded servlet container (front-end)
* Hibernate Validator, Validation API
* Add HATEOAS features to your services

<a name="DependencyInjection"></a>

## Dependency Injection #

There are two parts to dependency injectioon.

Java annotations are used to define the java bean to manage and tests doing the managing.

`@Component` marks the class definitions to manage.

`@Autowired` marks where a mock the correct match for this specific type.

In a unit test, I can ask the Spring framework to auto-wire the mock of WelcomeService into WelcomeController. (Spring Boot makes things easy to do this with @MockBean.
