This repo is about making use of utilities that install software on various operating systems.

There are different package managers for each operating system and language:

| Operating System | Command | File  | Folder        |
| ---------------- | ------- | ----- |-------------- |
| Red Hat, Fedora, CentOS | [yum](#YUM) | .rpm | /var/lib/rpm |
| Debian, Ubuntu | [apt-get](#apt), dpkg | .deb | apt repositories |
| SUSE, openSUSE | [zypper](#zypper) | .rpm | - |
| MacOS            | brew   | - | Homebrew.org |
| Windows          | choco   | .nuget | Chocolatey.org |
| Java             | mvn | pom.xml | - | - |
| Ruby             | [rake](#rake) | .gemfile | - | - |
| Node             | npm | .npm | - | - |
| Python           | pip   | package.json | - | - |

Some were developed by the same people who wrote the operating system or

Other (in the case of Mac, Windows) were developed by others.

Each package manager have a different architecture and way of working.

They all have similar functionality:

1. The package manager utility is downloaded and installed.
2. Packages are stored in a website or a local network folder.
3. A text file associated with each application specifies the files to be downloaded and installed for that application.
4. A utility is run to download and install packages based on the specification file.
5. A utility is run to list what has been installed by various specification files.
6. A utility is run to provide information about each package.
7. A utility is run to identify updates and installs them.
8. A utility is run to identify which others are dependent on a package.
9. A utility is run to remove packages for an application (to free up disk space).

## RPM

1. RPM comes with Red Hat, Fedora, and CentOS operating systems.

   The RPM database is located by default at:<br />
   <strong>/var/lib/rpm</strong>

2. RPM works with files from DVD media or file folder.

3. Files for each app are defined in .rpm files.

4. To install files specified in an .rpm file from that application's folder:

   <pre><strong>rpm ?
   </strong></pre>

   To -install a package from a source:

   <pre><strong>rpm -i <em>package</em>.rpm
   </strong></pre>

5. To -query a -list of all rpms installed:

   <pre><strong>rpm -ql
   </strong></pre>

   "x86_64" is for 64-bit x86 (Intel) machines.

6. To -query -package -information:

   <pre><strong>rpm -qpi <em>package</em>.rpm
   </strong></pre>

7. To update:

   <pre><strong>rpm -u
   </strong></pre>

8. To -identify which others are dependent on a package:

   <pre><strong>rpm -i <em>package</em>.rpm
   </strong></pre>

9. To remove packages for an app:

   <pre><strong>rpm -e <em>myapp</em>
   </strong></pre>



<a name="zypper"></a>

## Zypper for SUSE

1. The SUSE and openSUSE operating systems also use .rpm files.

   However, SUSE use the zypper se packagename.

   The RPM database is located by default at:<br />
   <strong>/var/lib/rpm</strong>

2. RPM works with files from DVD media or file folder.

3. Files for each app are defined in .rpm files.

4. To install files specified in an .rpm file from that application's folder:

   </strong></pre>

7. To update:

   <pre><strong>zypper update
   </strong></pre>

8. To -identify which others are dependent on a package:

   <pre><strong>?
   </strong></pre>

9. To remove packages for an app:

   <pre><strong>zypper rm <em>myapp</em>
   </strong></pre>
