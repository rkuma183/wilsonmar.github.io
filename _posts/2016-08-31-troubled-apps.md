{% include _toc.html %}

I'm looking for apps (with source) that are designed to be in trouble, that exhibit undesired behavior,
such as:

   * memory leaks
   * CPU hot spots
   * n+1 problem (makes many more API calls to server)
   * Too many SQL calls 
   * Slow SQL
   * etc.

Most of the apps I've seen are from vendors:

HP LoadRunner has a WebTours app.


### n+1 problem 

The n+1 problem is when regression test finds client makes many more API calls to server.

0. Launch servers under test

   The starting of the various tiers and the enabling/disabling of different problem pattern plugins is done via a separate easyTravel Launcher. The Launcher allows the user to conveniently switch between different demo scenarios. Each scenario can define load scripts and certain problem pattern plugins that are enabled. The scenarios can be modified or extended by changing an XML file. This is useful when giving demos and allows you to focus on <em>problem areas</em> that are particularly relevant for a specific demo.
