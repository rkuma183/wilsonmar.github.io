This page provides you a way to apply my research on managing APIs.

> I provide here a structure and approach for wisely selecting from among several vendors.

But before opening your checkbook, consider the Why and how:

## Business Model Why

<img width="476" alt="api-monitization-model-952x510" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/15186420/3419291c-175a-11e6-99de-3cbe628d7460.png">

PROTIP: While public APIs get a lot of press (due in part to marketing spend),
implementing thru partners achieves indirect monitization

After Netflix opened their API, they identified partners
and <strong>new channels</strong> they didn't anticipate.

   * increase brand image

Implementing private APIs among employees only may achieve
cost savings from control, and standardization.

   * Improve discoverability (for reuse and greater agility)
   * Present uniform facade

## Major logical components

<img width="831" alt="azure-api-1662x756" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/15144405/73c9199e-166c-11e6-97d3-a19557e4b033.png">

0. <a href="#PublisherFeatures"> API Publisher portal</a> (for use by admins)

0. <a href="#DeveloperFeatures"> API Developer portal</a> to learn system

0. <a href="#GatewayFeatures"> Proxy (API Gateway)</a> does re-writing, format conversion, rate limiting (throttling).

The diagram for Amazon's API Gateway summarizes the challenge:

<img align="right" width="652" height="316" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/14916299/fdbb3b36-0dd5-11e6-9fed-ed4c6576200e.png">
<!-- 887x430 -->

   * Calls come from a variety of sources (mobile and IoT apps, AJAX websites, services from customer servers)
   * Traffic comes through public cellular and internet networks
   * Load balancing is necessary to distribute load across many servers.
   * Caching is important for speed.

## Lifecycle functionality

PROTIP: Attend webinars by leading vendors to see how they justify their higher prices with features that cover the full lifecycle:

![api-dev-model-mulesoft-1371x1143](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/15156711/85bd51ae-16a5-11e6-9ef2-921a23ff9739.jpg)

The diagram above from MuleSoft presents names for the range of functionality that you may not know you need,
and then later realize <a target="_blank" alt="api-mulesoft-products-2880x1800" href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/15156952/a7619f4e-16a6-11e6-95fd-81c232b2e0ba.png">
their products</a>
are needed to avoid extra costs and effort.

## Different strategies over time

QUESTION: What are the benefits of discoverability, collaboration, ease of integration, etc.
and other advanced features offered by vendors?

PROTIP: Consider the strategy of getting going quickly with a vendor which offers low-cost <a href="#StartupCost">start-up costs</a>.
Then your organization can gain the experience needed to more wisely evaluate the value of additional features among all vendors.


<a name="TotalPoints"></a>

## Total points for each option

Forrester, in their April 2015 report, classified the vendors this way:
<img width="689" height="408" alt="api vendors in forrester 2015" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/14916539/6c5fe680-0dd7-11e6-9149-6b803194e134.png"><!-- 1378x862 -->

Forrester also illustrated the history of offerings with this timeline:
<img alt="api vendors timeline forrester 2015" width="652" height="361" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/14919580/b55db79a-0de6-11e6-9377-553fba4b4366.jpg"><!-- 1346x744 -->
This was adjusted for Tibco buying Mashery from Intel in August, 2015.

### Gartner Magic Quadrant

![gartner-api-governance-2015](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/15166279/858e6896-16da-11e6-9075-76191c993feb.png)


<a href="#Importance"></a>

## Importance of each criteria

<img align="right" width="383" height="301" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/14914831/086b982e-0dcb-11e6-9859-9c5d67f8a31d.png">
<!-- 766x602 -->

This radar polar chart visually illustrates the relative importance of
each criteria we used to evaluate options.

If everything has the same importance, no trade-offs are considered.

These represent extent of risk and effort, and cost savings or earnings.

Semi-transparent layers are used so both layers can be seen clearly.




<a name="Ratings"></a>

## Ratings for each criteria

There is usually a trade-off between cost vs. speed vs. quality (the "Iron Triangle").
But here are more considerations:

![polar-chart-2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/14914539/44f83b42-0dc8-11e6-84ff-ba8c2317a808.png)

TODO: The above is an example placeholder.


<a name="VariationAmongRaters"></a>

## Variation among raters

Each rating is the average of ratings among several raters.

<hr />

<a name="NFRCriteria"></a>

## Non-Functional Criteriae

Each of these are a risk and an aspect of cost/benefit.

   How does it save time and money, reduce risk, or earn more revenue?

   How do "bells and whistles" benefit?


<a name="StartupCost"></a>

### Initial Cost

Lower up-front cost is important for many.

   * 3scale, Apigee, and WSO2 have options for no-cost, unlimited duration use of their API management solutions (though support is typically limited or unavailable).

   * Amazon API Gateway has a free tier for one million API calls per month for up to 12 months.

   * Microsoft charges Developers $49/month
   and limits access to 10 users.

### Cost over time

BLAH: <a target="_blank" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/api-management/">
Microsoft pricing</a>
 bundles pre-defined amounts of calls, cache, and network services together in <strong>units</strong> for billing.

Amazon charges for different services separately:

   * API calls by the million received depend on location of servers:
   <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/pricing/">Amazon charges</a>:

   | Locale    | per million |
   | US        | $3.50 |
   | Ireland   | $3.50 |
   | Frankfurt | $3.70 |
   | Asia Pac. | $4.25 |

   * Data transfer out to internet.  Amazon:

   | Volume     | per TB |
   |    0-10 TB | $0.120 |
   |   11-40 TB | $0.085 |
   |  41-100 TB | $0.082 |
   | 101-350 TB | $0.080 |

### Style / Ease of Use

   * The hipness of UI - default layouts inviting, clean, etc.
   * Familiarity

These are important because human UI are needed for:

   * Developer Sign-up
   * API key assignment
   * API public/private key creation
   * Provide documentation
   * Provide code samples
   * Discussion forums to provide support
   * Send emails to update
   * Report errors by user for each account

### Coordination

The need for an API Gateway is to avoid legacy point-to-point communications among computers.

   * Partner management
   * Traffic management

   * service coordinator, (android device hits one service instead of 100 micro services)
   * Billing
   * Emails about changes

   * Predictive analytics. Apigee illustrates their Insights service which yields a buying Propensity score salespeople use to prioritize efforts:

<img alt="apigee predictive insights" width="652" height="367" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/14917568/fe2c91c6-0ddc-11e6-87d4-fabffe317f07.png"><!-- 668x376 -->


### Security

   Does the security mechanisms provided strong enough?

   * Transport security (TLS)
   * Authentication (passwords, two-factor cellphone)
   * Initial registration
   * Password recovery
   * KPI (public/private) certificates?
   * Identity and access management
   * Verify api keys

<a target="_blank" href="https://pages.apigee.com/eBook-API-First-Security-Dont-Build-Your-Own-Maginot-Line-conf.html">
Apigee
uses this illustration:
<img alt="apigee security" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/14917830/253f56a8-0dde-11e6-9446-18a52ef1a1fb.png"></a>
<!-- 668x376 -->

    * No data at rest
    * http://www.mashery.com/api/security prides itself on being certified on PCI, HITRUST CSF, SSAE, Safe Harbor, SOC 2, etc.


### Flexibility

   How flexible is it? Are we sacrificing too much flexibility for ease-of-setup?

   * Redirect calls to API's URIs
   * Auto-detect new services added

   * Support for steaming API protocols WebSocket and XMPP
   * Support for two-legged or three-legged OAuth and OpenID Connect authentication
   * Onboard SAML security token service for federation and credential translation
   * Support for external SSO (Single Sign-On)
   * LDAP user provisioning for services like Web applications and social networks

### Maintainability

   What maintenance is needed?

   * Manual work: Annual, monthly, weekly, daily, hourly, etc.
   * Adding additional languages

   * Logging (AWS CloudWatch monitoring)

      | Item | US Cost/Mo. | Note |
      | Dashboards | $3.00 | - |
      | Detailed Monitoring for Amazon EC2 Instances | $3.50 per instance | 1-minute frequency |
      | Custom Metrics | $0.50 |
      | Alarms | $0.10 |
      | API Requests | $0.01 | per 1,000 GetMetricStatistics, ListMetrics, or PutMetricData requests |
      | Logs ingested | $0.50 | per GB |
      | Logs archived | $0.03 | per GB |
      | Custom Events | $1.00 | per million |

### Scalability

   How quickly, easily, and safely can the system expand to meet capacity needs?

   * Load balancing (AWS CLoudFront)
   * DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack detection and mitigation (at DNS level)
   * Traffic Throttling based on user's plan
   * Traffic Throttling for capacity limitations
   * The "Actor" model of Microsoft Service Fabric
   * Caching

Microsoft Azure routes traffic to a region providing the least latency for each user:

<a target="_blank" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/traffic-manager-routing-methods/#performance-traffic-routing-method">
<img src="https://acom.azurecomcdn.net/80C57D/cdn/mediahandler/docarticles/dpsmedia-prod/azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/traffic-manager-routing-methods/20160415071221/ic753237.jpg"></a>

### Speed

   * Cache
   * International end-points

   * Cache memory per hour.  Amazon:

   | Volume     | per hr. |
   |     0.5 TB | $0.028 |
   |     1.6 TB | $0.054 |
   |     6.1 TB | $0.245 |
   |    13.5 TB | $0.290 |
   |    28.4 TB | $0.560 |
   |    58.2 TB | $1.100 |
   |   118.0 TB | $2.200 |
   |   237.0 TB | $4.400 |

### I18N (Internationalization)

   * UI Language
   * Data centers
   * Currencies

### Availability

   * Partial deployment
   * Fault tolerance

### Support

   How well supported is it?

   This is part of the cost. Support costs money.

### Training

   How quickly and deeply can people get up to speed on the technology?

   How easy is to to learn/maintain?

   This is a consideration of costs and risks.

   * Document generation

### Testability

   * Amazon API Gateway can generate client SDKs in a number of programming languages, including JavaScript, iOS, and Android.

   * Mock server generation
   * Test script generation

### Portability

   How easy is it to switch among competing vendors? Is there vendor lock-in?

   * Switch from Azure to AWS, other PaaS is not possible because Azure is a pure SaaS running on Azure
   * How to extract data?

### Vendor prospects

   What is the sentiment about the vendor?

   * History of product cancellations
   * Investment advisory financial ratings
   * Consumer ratings by JD Power
   * Glassdoor ratings by employees

   * Response time (in ms)
   * Bandwidth usage KB
   * Successful? Popular === Volume of <strong>calls</strong>.
   * <strong>Errors</strong> === Number of calls blocked due to limits?

   Notice the pre-defined filters for Today, yesterday, Last 7 Days,
   Last 30 Days, Last 90 Days

   Activity chart provides reports that drill down on the specific activity by developer, product, API, and operation.

What about:

   * Specific translations performed
   * Specific policies violated
   * metrics by geography
   * Correlation of two metrics (response time vs bandwidth scattergram)

   * Issues over time

#### App Fabric

<a target="_blank" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/service-fabric/">
Microsoft Service Fabric</a> (in GA April 2016)
has
<a target="_blank" href="http://tryazureservicefabric.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/">
several free "party" clusters</a> that last for less than 4 hours each.

In order to build and run Azure Service Fabric applications on your development machine,
you need to install the runtime, SDK, and tools.
You also need to enable execution of the Windows PowerShell 3.0 scripts included in the SDK.

To use Service Fabric PowerShell cmdlets on Windows 7,
which includes Windows PowerShell 2.0 by default,
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=50395">
download the Windows Management Framework 5.0 which includes PowerShell 3.0</a> as well as
Desired State Configuration (DSC), Windows Remote Management (WinRM), Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).
See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=717903

The Party Cluster is created by code at
https://github.com/Azure-Samples/service-fabric-dotnet-management-party-cluster

Not AzurePS

The local cluster manager :

"C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Service Fabric\Tools\ServiceFabricLocalClusterManager\ServiceFabricLocalClusterManager.exe"

Pin this to the taskbar.

Microsoft Service Fabric is about more than API management.
Its features and patterns for application development, including:

0.    Stateful Reliable Services with Reliable Collections.
0.    Dependency injection and unit testing with Reliable Services.
0.    How to use Service Fabric configuration packages, both the built-in Settings.xml config and custom JSON configuration, with rolling updates without restarting services.
0.    How to encrypt sensitive data in Service Fabric configuration packages.
0.    Inter-service communication using the Service Fabric remoting stack.
0.    Diagnostics with Elastic Search through ETW event sources.
0.    How to write a stateless Web API front-end service.
