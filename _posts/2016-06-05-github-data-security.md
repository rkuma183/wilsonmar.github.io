In our individual machines, 
we use the `ssh-keygen` utility to generate key pairs.
The public key we copy into each <strong>server</strong> 
so we can <strong>`SSH`</strong>
with the private side of the pair (instead of a password).

PROTIP: For those who only want to create credential once,
one approach is to store credentials in a <strong>cloud drive</strong>
(such as Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, or Microsoft OneDrive).
Credentials there can be downloaded along with
<strong>SSH scripts</strong> to simplify execution.

Some prefer to use an encrypted USB Solid State Drive
for sole physical posession. But if that's lost or stolen,
security can be compromised.

The application 1Password takes a compromise approach of
allowing password crypts to be transferred among multiple local devices,
but not over a public network.

### Git #

As we write functions within application source files,
we put them within a Git folder,
and commit changes into .git history.

The private <strong>API keys</strong> and 
crypto certificates from Certificate Authorities
we collectively call <strong>secrets</strong> 
for accessing web services
can be conveninently just copied into the Git folder.

When files are pushed up to GitHub or other repository,
<strong>.gitignore</strong> settings should 
prevent the certificate from being uploaded and thus risk exposure.

PROTIP: Many say it's NOT a good idea to keep secrets such as passwords and 
other private data in a GitHub repository. 
Murphy's Law applies here too.

Rogue "dorking" scanners are looking through 
every public repository, looking for secrets.

PROTIP: Organizations should do their own scans 
to find issues before others do.

If private information is found, we
can use <a href="#BFG">the BFG utility to remove it</a>.

CAUTION: But even after data is removed from the <strong>current</strong> repository,
like the Padora's Box legend,
whatever was exposed can nevertheless live on in 
any forks, clones, or zip files
others have taken of the repository.

A more secure approach is to define a 
<a href="#ConfigScript">configuration script</a> that establishes a 
<a href="#Symlink">symlink</a> 
to reference secret files in folders outside of the Git repository.

Private file in them can be referenced in 
<strong>profile scripts</strong> that load files and
<a href="#EnvVars">environment variables</a> 
within memory accessible by application programs.


## Dorking scans #

There are utilities (called "dorking") 
that scan through all GitHub repos looking for exposed keys.

<a name="BFG"></a>

## Get it out of there! #

What if you found out that your private data has been exposed in a GitHub repo?

PROTIP: If a file is deleted using `git rm` and a commit is made,
a vestige of that data still exist in the repository's <strong>history</strong> (.git folder).

Utility program <a target="_blank" href="http://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/">
   BFG Repo-Cleaner</a> 
   (bfg.jar) is faster due to it being written in Scala (a varient of Java).
<a target="_blank" href="https://help.github.com/articles/remove-sensitive-data/">
This webpage</a> explains commands such as replacing such as this to 
find known passwords and replace them with <strong>\*\*\*REMOVED\*\*\*</strong>.

   <pre>
   java -jar bfg.jar --replace-text passwords.txt  my-repo.git
   </pre>

Git is designed such that every file and folder is represented only once (and given a unique SHA-1 hash-id).

Git has a <a target="_blank" href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-filter-branch">
`git-filter-branch` command</a> which 
<strong>rebuilds</strong> a repo one commit at a time without the offending
content. The Git Real 2 course covers this.

0. Make commits and push so there is nothing in your local staging area.

0. Zip up the repo so you have a fall-back.

0. Make a copy of the repo as backup:

   `git clone poodles burning-poodles`

0. Rebuild the repo one commit at a time after applying the shell script
   rm function to remove the secrets.txt file from 
   --all commit files: (change secrets.txt to your file's name)

   `git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f secrets.txt -- --all'`

   Note .gitignore rules are not applied here.

   This is a very I/O intensive operation and will take a long time on larger repos.

0. There are options that change other information:

   `--env-filter` rewrites author/committer name/email/time environment variables

   `--msg-filter` rewrites commit message text.

0. Remove (prune) commits which are now empty becuase the offending file they reference
   have been removed:

   `git filter-branch -f --prune-empty`

0. Notify all those who may have forked or cloned or downloaded the repo.


<a name="ConfigScript"></a>

## Config Script #

You can tell Git to ignore changes to a file in the future:

   <pre><strong>
   git update-index --assume-unchanged  <em>file</em>
   </strong></pre>

   However, this works only on a single branch.
   On a change of branch, Git detects changes in the config file, and you'll have to either undo them, or check them in.

To track changes again:

   <pre><strong>
   git update-index --no-assume-unchanged <em>file</em>
   </strong></pre>

   * http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/602146/Keeping-sensitive-config-settings-secret-with-Azur

   * http://gitready.com/intermediate/2009/02/18/temporarily-ignoring-files.html

Another option is to use pre and post-commit hooks to automatically add/remove secret config values when checking in and out, using a Python program.



### Certificate from file ###

   In Bash, an export command is used to bring in the
   public key generated by ssh-gen into the user's home hidden
   .ssh folder:

   <pre>
   export RSA_PUBLIC_KEY=$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)
   </pre>

   But PowerShell's equivalent reads
   certificate files created using putty-gen
   or Mysysgit (the Git client for Windows):

   <pre><strong>
   $RSA_PUBLIC_KEY = Get-Content "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
   # echo "RSA_PUBLIC_KEY=$RSA_PUBLIC_KEY"
   </strong></pre>

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.simple-talk.com/sysadmin/powershell/powershell-one-liners-accessing-handling-and-writing-data/#first">
   Among the many variations</a>:

   <pre>
   $RSA_PUBLIC_KEY = [IO.File]::ReadAllText("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub").split("`n")
   </pre>

   The split method using the back-tick adds a trailing empty line at 
   the bottom of the file.


### Secrets file to Hash Table ###

   On my Mac I used a text editor to create a 
   text file containing these (fake) secrets:

   <pre>
GITHUB_PASSWORD = '234sdsdvs32'
GITHUB_TOKEN = '1234567890123456789012345678901234567890'
   </pre>

   Notice there are no dollar signs in front of the key names.

   PROTIP: I prefre to not store the user name along with its password.

   The file is stored in a .secrets file (no extension)
   in my Mac user home folder, so they can be invoked as a Bash script:

   <tt><strong>
   source ~/.secrets
   </strong></tt>

   NOTE: The dot command is equivalent to the source command.

   BLAH: The Bash "source" function is not recognized by PowerShell
   and variables need to have dollar signs. So rather than
   creating a password file containing:

   <pre>
$GITHUB_PASSWORD = '234sdsdvs32'
$GITHUB_TOKEN = '1234567890123456789012345678901234567890'
   </pre>

   I can also create a .ps1 file which defines a <strong>hashtable</strong>
   (a collection of key/value pairs, also called "associative arrays"):

   <pre>
   [ordered]@{Key1=Value1;Key2=Value2}
   </pre>

   However, I prefer to read the text file previously read by Bash
   so I end up with a hash table named $SECRETS in PowerShell,
   from which it retireves a specific property:

   <pre><strong>
   $SECRETS = Get-Content "$home/.secrets" | ConvertFrom-StringData
   # don't echo $SECRETS.GITHUB_PASSWORD
   # don't echo $SECRETS.GITHUB_TOKEN
   </strong></pre>

## AWS CLI Configuration #

Although AWS in 2015 enabled users to 
<a target="_blank" href="https://blogs.aws.amazon.com/security/post/Tx1XWZ93EAFL9C4/How-to-Switch-Easily-Between-AWS-Accounts-by-Using-the-AWS-Management-Console-an">
switch roles in the Console</a>, switching roles in the CLI is not yet availble.

AWS provides a command to define admin access:

   <pre>
   aws configure
   </pre>

List the location on a Mac or Linux machine:

   <pre>
   ls ~/.aws
   </pre>

List the location on Windows:

   <pre>
   dir %UserProfile%\.aws
   </pre>

Insidie the .aws folder is a <strong>credentials</strong> file containing, for example:

   <pre>
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = ABCDEFGVSYNHR5G2VNGQ
   aws_secret_access_key = 123456nVqH3AWz5pGQcZ/+JDHB4dBM2BDNtzUsnK

   [user2]
   aws_access_key_id=AKIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE
   aws_secret_access_key=je7MtGbClwBF/2Zp9Utk/h3yCo8nvbEXAMPLEKEY
   </pre>

On a Mac, store:

   <pre>
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='YOUR_AWS_API_KEY'
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='YOUR_AWS_API_SECRET_KEY'
   </pre>

   * https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/getting-started-with-ansible-and-dynamic-amazon-ec2-inventory-management/

Insidie the .aws folder is a <strong>config</strong> file containing, for example:

   <pre>
   [default]
   region=us-west-2
   output=json

   [profile e1]
   region=us-east-1
   output=text
   </pre>

   PROTIP: Define profile names with the region.

   <pre>
   aws s3 ls \-\-profile default
   </pre>


See http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html#cli-config-files


Configuration includes enabling auto completion for AWS CLI, 
edit file <strong>/etc/bashrc</strong> to add:

   <pre>
   complete -C aws_completer aws
   </pre>

<a name="Symlink"></a>

## Symlink Configuration #

On a Mac, this sample command is used to create a symlink. For example:

   <pre>
   ln -s ~/.aws/credentials  credentials
   ln -s ~/.aws/config  config
   </pre>

On Windows, a "Shortcut" is created to a file.


<a name="CloudSync"></a>

## Sync from Dropbox #

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.technorange.com/cloudlinker-direct-link-generator-for-dropboxgoogle-driveone-drive-copy-com/">
This on-line tool</a> generates a direct link from a share link into
Dropbox, Google Drive, and Microsoft OneDrive.


<a name="EnvVars"></a>

## Enviornment variables #

To insert secret key in a Mac's .bash_profile script that the operating system executes upon boot-up, on can:

   {% highlight text %}
   echo "export SECRET_PASS=12345678910" >> ~/app-root/data/.bash_profile{% endhighlight %}

   But this is not as secure as k

Programming to retrieve an environment variable into the program:

   * Python programs reference `process.env.SECRET_PASS`.

   * PHP programs use `getenv('SECRET_PASS');`.

   * C# programs use `System.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SECRET_PASS", _<br />EnvironmentVariableTarget.Process)`.

NOTE: Internet browser sandboxing restricts JavaScript from accessing operating system
environment variables.


## Automatic Encryption

<a target="_blank" 
 href="github-data-security-git-v04-1010x479-113713.jpg" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/38212884-a4e2121a-367c-11e8-8f2d-5fdb81824943.jpg">
<img alt="github-data-security-git-v04-640x304-60868.jpg" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/38212936-d1cdd5ac-367c-11e8-97c2-9f047febbbfe.jpg"></a>

Automation scripts running on the desktop often need to provide passwords to various web services. It's inconvenient to type the credentials in every time the script runs, especially when it's run overnight on a schedule. Some make the credentials available in a secrets file on their laptop, with contents in <strong>clear text</strong> so they can be changed. 

When git add, commit, and push commands are issued to a folder initialized for git, files specified in <strong>.gitignore</strong> are blocked from being uploaded to GitHub or other online repository. 

The problem with this approach is that if the local secrets file is ever deleted, or the whole laptop is destroyed or stolen, the secrets are gone too.

What we want to consider here is an <strong>encrypted</strong> secrets file resting, encrypted, within the GitHub cloud and brought down locally by a git fetch or pull. This means that changes would be versioned. But what the changes are would not be evident due to the encrytion.

Mechanisms for encryption and decryption is provided by a utility GitHub repository installed on Mac laptops using Homebrew from:

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sobolevn/git-secret">
   https://github.com/sobolevn/git-secret</a>
   <br /><br />

The repository from sobolevn in Moscow, Russia, who specializes in Elixir. His library provides for initalization of a .gitsecrets folder to hold <strong>public keys</strong> created using the GPG utility. Its "tell" program emails the private keys it creates so it's off the machine.

Encrypted files do not need to be automatically decrypted into clear text file until secrets need to be <strong>edited</strong> to change the behavior desired in shell scripts when they are run.

The secreate file can be encrypted automatically on <strong>git commit</strong> when a git hook program recognizes the need for encryption so the file can be safely pushed into GitHub again. 

If the script has code to decrypt the secret files itself based on the public key generated, the clear text file can be <strong>removed</strong> locally after editing. There is then no need for the clear text file to be referenced.

When someone is out - just delete their public key, re-encrypt the files, and they won’t be able to decrypt secrets anymore.

PROTIP: This is not a totally secure approach for extremely sensitive production data
because, any encryption can be hacked given enough time using on supercomputers now commonly available to hackers.
