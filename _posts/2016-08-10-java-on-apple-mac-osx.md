There are several ways to install Java.
This is the one that worked for me.

<a name="AppleJavaC"></a>

### Apple Java

WARNING: The version that comes installed on Apple Macs can be obsolete.

CAUTION: Do not delete the default version.
But if you did, to re-install <strong>Java 6</strong> for OS X 2014-001,
it can be obtained from
<a target="_blank" href="https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_US">
https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_US</a>

## Which Java You Got?

On a Terminal open to any folder:

0. To see what JRE you have already installed:

   <pre><strong>
   java -version
   </strong></pre>

   A sample response:

   <pre>
java version "1.8.0_06-ea"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_06-ea-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.2-b04, mixed mode)
   </pre>

0. PROTIP: Developers use the JDK rather than the JRE (Runtime Environment),
   see what version of the Java Compiler is installed:

   <pre><strong>
   javac -version
   </strong></pre>

   A sample response:

   <pre>
   javac 1.8.0_74
   </pre>

   If it's not installed, MacOS prompts you to install the JDK.
   Clever. But don't do it if you want the Oracle version.

0. Click <strong>More Info...</strong>.

   <pre><strong>
   /usr/libexec/java_home -V
   </strong></pre>

   That's a capital V.

   The response on my machine:

   <pre>
Matching Java Virtual Machines (4):
1.8.0_45, x86_64:	"Java SE 8"	/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_45.jdk/Contents/Home
1.7.0_65, x86_64:	"Java SE 7"	/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_65.jdk/Contents/Home
1.6.0_65-b14-466.1, x86_64:	"Java SE 6"	/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home
1.6.0_65-b14-466.1, i386:	"Java SE 6"	/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_45.jdk/Contents/Home
   </pre>

   PROTIP: In OSX, all known JVM's are located at:

   <pre>
   /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/
   </pre>

0. The $JAVA_HOME environment variable is used by Groovy, Grails, Spring Boot, and others:

   <tt><strong>
   echo $JAVA_HOME
   </strong></tt>

   The response:

   <pre>
   /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_102.jdk/Contents/Home
   </pre>

0. See what derivative program such as Maven uses:

   <tt><strong>
   mvn -version
   </strong></tt>

   The sample response:

   <pre>
Apache Maven 3.3.9 (bb52d8502b132ec0a5a3f4c09453c07478323dc5; 2015-11-10T09:41:47-07:00)
Maven home: /usr/local/Cellar/maven/3.3.9/libexec
Java version: 1.8.0_74, vendor: Oracle Corporation
Java home: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_74.jdk/Contents/Home/jre
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: US-ASCII
OS name: "mac os x", version: "10.11.5", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"
   </pre>

0. See:

   <tt><strong>
   command -v java
   </strong></tt>

   If you get this:

   <pre>
   /usr/bin/java
   </pre>

   ### Latest Version of Oracle Java #

0. PROTIP: <strong>Hold off downloading</strong> the java .dmg installer file,
   as described at
   <a target="_blank" href="https://java.com/en/download/help/mac_install.xml">
   https://java.com/en/download/help/mac_install.xml</a>

   WARNING: Oracle installs an annoying Ask Toolbar, sometimes without asking.

   Oracles docs on installing the JDK:<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/mac_jdk.html">

   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a>

   
   ### Multiple Versions of JDK #

0. Click the "Download" button for the JDK (not the JRE).

   NOTE: Downloads of the JDK contains the JRE.

   <a name="JenvInstall"></a>

   ### Install Jenv to manage multiple Versions of Java #

   PROTIP: If you're a developer, 
   you'll likely need to manage different versions of Java needed by different apps.
   Much like NPM for Node
   and [rbenv for Ruby](/ruby-on-apple-mac-osx/).

   <br />
   describes the steps.

0. Install Jenv by specifying the location URL:

   <tt><strong>
   brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/entrypass/jenv/homebrew/homebrew/jenv.rb
   </strong></tt>

   The long response:

   The destination of the install is different than standard Java install:

   <pre>
   Cloning into '/Users/mac/Library/Caches/Homebrew/jenv--git'...
   </pre>

0. Do what the jenv message says and 
   activate jenv by adding this to the bottom of the file
   activated when a Terminal shell window starts:

   <pre><strong>
   echo 'eval "$(jenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
   </strong></pre>

0. To see if jenv can run, list its version and commands:

   <tt><strong>
   jenv
   </strong></tt>

   The desired response is like this:

   <pre>
Usage: jenv <command> [<args>]
&nbsp;
Some useful jenv commands are:
   commands    List all available jenv commands
   local       Set or show the local application-specific Java version
   global      Set or show the global Java version
   shell       Set or show the shell-specific Java version
   rehash      Rehash jenv shims (run this after installing executables)
   version     Show the current Java version and its origin
   versions    List all Java versions available to jenv
   which       Display the full path to an executable
   whence      List all Java versions that contain the given executable

   PROTIP: Installing using clone means that you would have to manually check
   whether a new version is available, then manually do the upgrade.
   So instead of doing that, forget the ~/.jenv folder and do this:

0. Use Homebrew's directories rather than ~/.jenv add to the bottom of your profile file:

   <tt><strong>
   export JENV_ROOT=/usr/local/var/jenv
   </strong></tt>

0. To enable shims and autocompletion add to the botton of your profile file:
  
   <pre><strong>
   if which jenv > /dev/null; then eval "$(jenv init -)"; fi
   </strong></pre>

0. To see what jenv recognizes:

   ## Jenv for several Java versions

0. The point of jenv is to add additional versions, such as back version JDK 7:

   jenv add /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_65.jdk/Contents/Home
   </strong></pre>

   The response:

   <pre>
   oracle64-1.7.0.65 added
   </pre>


0. Add JDK 8:

   <pre><strong>
   jenv add /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_101.jdk/Contents/Home
   </strong></pre>

   http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u101-b13/jdk-8u101-macosx-x64.dmg

   <pre>
   oracle64-1.8.0.45 added
   </pre>


0. List the libraries jenv knows about:

   <pre><strong>
   jenv versions
   </strong></pre>

0. Highlight, copy and paste the version you want to use.

0. To configure global version:

   <pre><strong>
   jenv global oracle64-1.8.0.45
   </strong></pre>

   The response:

### Open JDK #

Open JDK is the open-sourced implementation of the
JRE spec, at
<a target="_blank" href="http://openjdk.java.net/">http://openjdk.java.net</a>
is at JVM 7.

  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Java_virtual_machines

But it is still not ready for "prime time" on Mac as installation is a dirty affair.

   * https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/MacOSXPort/Mac+OS+X+Port+Project+Status

Open JDK's
<a target="_blank" href="http://openjdk.java.net/install/">
install page at http://openjdk.java.net/install/</a>
shows apt-get (for Debian, Ubuntu) and
yum (for Red Hat, CentOS, Oracle Linus, Fedora).

<a target="_blank" href="http://gvsmirnov.ru/blog/tech/2014/02/07/building-openjdk-8-on-osx-maverick.html#tldr">
For OSX, this page recommends using Make to compile from source</a>.

0. Download source using Mercurial to a new folder "openjdk9":

   <tt><strong>
   hg clone http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/jdk9 openjdk9
   cd ./openjdk9
   </strong></tt>

   Note JDK 9 is under active development.

0. Install <a target="_blank" href="https://www.xquartz.org/"> XQuartz</a> for X Window System that runs on OSX:

   <tt><strong>
   brew install Caskroom/cask/xquartz<br />
   brew cask list

   NOTE: Downloaded /Library/Caches/Homebrew/xquartz-2.7.9.dmg was 7.9K

   xquartz staged at '/opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/xquartz/2.7.9' (73M)

0. cd to the .tar.gz directory containing the configure file for Make to use.
0. XQuartz fixes an error in this command:

   bash ./configure

0. Install apple-gcc42 the Apple C compiler.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://mihail.stoynov.com/2015/01/29/building-openjdk-9-on-a-osx-or-any-linux/">
   Mihail recommends</a>:

0. Install ccache compiler cache.

   <tt><strong>
   brew install ccache
   </strong></tt>

0. Make a symlink /usr/bin/gcc -> /usr/local/Cellar/apple-gcc42/4.2.1-5666.3/bin/gcc-4.2 (same for g++)

0. If you're at Mavericks Apply patches: 1, 2, 3, 4.

0. if you're at Mavericks Comment out NS_AVAILABLE(10_9, NA) in line 16 of /System/Library/Frameworks/Foundation.framework/Headers/NSUserNotification.h

9. Build:

   <tt><strong>
   make all<br />
   make install
   </strong></tt>

   Built image should be available at build/macosx-x86_64-normal-server-release/jdk/
