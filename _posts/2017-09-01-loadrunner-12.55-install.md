This is a tutorial on the different ways to get hands-on with LoadRunner 12.55.

## Cloud images

There are two different types of images:

   * LoadRunner UI after full install containing Controller as well as VuGen and Load Generator.
   * LoadRunner Load Generator only.
   
Each image is for a specific version of LoadRunner.

### Amazon LoadRunner UI

NOTE: The <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B0163LX7I6/">
   "HPE LoadRunner 150 Virtual Users Hourly Fees"</a> from HPE contains LoadRunner 12.53 patch 4
   on Windows Server 2012 R2 2012R2 x64 <strong>runs up a bill every hour</strong> even if you don't run jobs.
   Amazon pays HPE $25 per hour.

My "HPE_LoadRunner_12-55_CE_P4_Windows-2016x64_50_Users..." contains all components of
   LoadRunner 12.55 CE (a 50 user license) on a base of Windows 2016 x64.
   It also has Visual Studio 2017 CE installed.
   It does not have additional fees like HPE charges, only Amazon hourly fees.
   However, it is not hardened.

0. In IAM, setup a different account than your master account used for billing.

0. Get to EC2 from the AWS Management Console.
0. Click "Launch Instance".

0. Select a base image: "Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Base" which has a "Microsoft Windows 10" look and feel.
0. If you're just working on installation, select "t2.micro" for its Free tier eligible.

   PROTIP: Select "t2.medium" with 4 GB memory if you're going to use it to do anything real.

0. Click Next: Configure Instance Details.
