This is a tutorial on the different ways to get hands-on with LoadRunner 12.55.

* Amazon Cloud
* <a href="#Azure">Microsoft Azure</a>
* <a href="#GCloud">Google Cloud Compute</a>

<hr />

## Amazon Cloud images

There are two different types of images:

   * LoadRunner UI after full install containing Controller as well as VuGen and Load Generator.
   * LoadRunner Load Generator only.
   
Each image is for a specific version of LoadRunner.

### Amazon LoadRunner UI

NOTE: The <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B0163LX7I6/">
   "HPE LoadRunner 150 Virtual Users Hourly Fees"</a> from HPE contains LoadRunner 12.53 patch 4
   on Windows Server 2012 R2 2012R2 x64 <strong>runs up a bill every hour</strong> even if you don't run jobs.
   Amazon pays HPE $25 per hour.

My "HPE_LoadRunner_12-55_CE_P4_Windows-2016x64_50_Users" contains all components of
   LoadRunner 12.55 CE (a 50 user license) on a base of Windows 2016 x64.
   It also has Visual Studio 2017 CE installed.
   It does not have additional fees like HPE charges, only Amazon hourly fees.
   However, it is not hardened.

Use my image:

0. Get an Amazon account.
0. In IAM, setup a different account than your master account used for billing.

0. Get to EC2 from the AWS Management Console.
0. Click "Launch Instance".

   #### Make use of an existing image

   NOTE: The image available was "rebundled" for your use after following instructions below.

   This sequence is similar to https://www.guru99.com/creating-amazon-ec2-instance.html
   and https://community.saas.hpe.com/t5/LoadRunner-and-Performance/Step-by-step-instructions-to-Provision-Load-Generators-in-the/ba-p/245072#.WaW1-pOGNZo

0. Get to EC2 from the AWS Management Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home
0. Login with your credentials.
0. Select the Region at the upper right. For example, the N. California:

   https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-1#

0. Click the blue "Launch Instance" button.
0. Select a base image: "Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Base" (Data Center Edition). 
   It has a "Microsoft Windows 10" look and feel.

   NOTE: If you were to construct a Load Generator instead, you would instead select "Amazon Linux AMI...".

0. If you're just working on installation, select "t2.micro" because it's Free tier eligible.

   PROTIP: Select "t2.medium" with 4 GB memory if you're going to use it to do anything real.

0. Click Next: Configure Instance Details.
0. Select a VPC you've defined previously. If you haven't, open another window and do that first.
0. Scroll down to expand Advanced Details to specify server start-up commands:

   <pre>
&LT;powershell>
Install-WindowsFeature Web-Server -IncludeManagementTools -IncludeAllSubFeature
&LT;/powershell>
   </pre>

0. Click "Next: Add Storage". Defaults are for the machine chosen earlier (for t2.micro, 30 GiB, General Purpose SSD, not encrypted).

   PROTIP: Amazon's current maximum volume size that can be given to a General Purpose volume is 16GB.

0. Click "Next: Add Tags".
0. Click "Add Tag". In Key, type `Name`. In Value, type `LR1255` (rather than "Web Server").
0. Click "Next: Configure Security Group". 
0. Use default "Create a new security group" and the random name created.
0. For Security Group Name, use the "RDP" automatically selected for the Windows server.
0. Click Add Rule. For its Type, select HTTPS. Leave Port as 443. For its Source, select Anywhere.
0. Click "Review and Launch".
0. Click "Launch".
0. Click OK to the security warning if it appears.
0. Create a new key pair.  (But in Quiklab, Choose an existing one)
0. Type a Key Pair Name such as "HPE_LoadRunner_12-55_CE_P4_Windows-2016x64_50_Users-20171001"
0. Click Download Key Pair. <strong>.pem</strong> file. The default is your Downloads folder.
0. Click Lauch Instances. CAUTION: Charges now begin accumulating.
0. Click View Instances.
0. Scroll down to copy the <strong>IPv4 Public IP</strong> such as 54.219.170.140

### Access server via RDP Windows

<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/connecting_to_windows_instance.html?icmpid=docs_ec2_console">
   Amazon's instructions</a>

0. Click the "Connect" icon at the top of the Console.

   ![ec2-connect-to-instance-677x409-140476](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30000812-04e7bd88-9036-11e7-9509-506a9192be03.jpg)

1. Click "Download Remote Desktop File" such as:

   `ec2-54-219-170-140.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com.rdp`

0. Double-click on the file to open the RDP client.

   Back to the dialog:

0. Click "Get Password".
0. Click "Browse..." and select Downloads, the .pem file downloaded earlier.
0. Click "Decrypt Password". 
0. Double-click on it to highlight it and press Ctrl+C to copy the string to your Windows Clipboard.
0. Open a Notepad file and paste it there so you won't lose it.
0. Click "Close" to dismiss the dialog.

   ### RDP Client

0. On Windows Explorer or MacOS Finder, doubl-click on the .rdp file saved earlier to invoke an RDP client program.
0. On the RDP client, click on the Password input field and paste the Clipboard contents.
0. Leave the Domain blank and click OK to connect.


### Configure the Windows Instance

1. Click the Windows icon and type enough of `server manager` for it to appear in the list. Click on it in the list.

   ...



### Browse the Default Web Site

### Accessing Metadata



### Stop or Terminate instance

When you're ready to ... in the EC2 Console, right-click on your instance 

   ![ec2-console-terminate-369x267-59878](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30000916-cf8b9a2a-9039-11e7-9e05-945b2d04a576.jpg)

If you select <strong>Stop</strong> of the instance, usage fees will stop. However, the root volume of the instance (EBS volume) is preserved and storage charges will continue to accure. But other devices that are attached to the instance keep on running, accumulating charges.

   PROTIP: Stopping an instance enables you to change the RAM, and even instance type to a bigger or smaller machine.

   CAUTION: Starting an instance re-starts the billing clock such that if you stop and start an instance within an hour, you will be billed for two hours.

If you select <strong>Terminate</strong>, you will need to go through the steps to create a new instance. The .rdp and .pem files downloaded are no longer valid.
