This is a hands-on tutorial on the different ways to get your hands on LoadRunner 12.55.

   * <a href="#ManualInstall">Install yourself manually</a>
   * <a href="#AmazonInstall">Amazon Cloud</a>
<!--
   * <a href="#Azure">Microsoft Azure</a>
   * <a href="#GCloud">Google Cloud Compute</a>
-->

There are different scopes of what is installed on a machine:

   * "<strong>LoadRunner VuGen</strong>" client only for use with Performance Center central web server, which presents collects and displays run results on a web page rather than via Controller and local Analysis.

   * "<strong>LoadRunner Load Generator</strong>" only for call by a separate Controller or Performance Center.    This is decribed at https://www.guru99.com/creating-amazon-ec2-instance.html
   and https://community.saas.hpe.com/t5/LoadRunner-and-Performance/Step-by-step-instructions-to-Provision-Load-Generators-in-the/ba-p/245072#.WaW1-pOGNZo

   * "<strong>LoadRunner UI</strong>" after full install of VuGen, Controller, and Analysis plus VTS and Load Generator on same machine for learning. This is the scope of this document.
   <br /><br />

Gaspare Marino, HPE Marketing, <a target="_blank" href="https://community.saas.hpe.com/t5/LoadRunner-and-Performance/Modernize-application-performance-testing-with-LoadRunner-and/ba-p/1611743">on August 30, 2017 points to version features in LoadRunner and Performance Center 12.55</a> to dispel competing vendors paining as a "dinosaur".

<a name="AmazonInstall"></a>

### Amazon LoadRunner UI

0. Get an Amazon account.
0. In IAM, setup a different account than your master account used for billing.

0. Get to EC2 from the AWS Management Console.
0. Click "Launch Instance".
0. Click <strong>Community AMIs</strong> and type <strong>LoadRunner</strong>.

   ![lr1253-ec2-758x394](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30002572-bf019b02-9069-11e7-98d4-600422efc495.jpg)

0. Click the <strong>4 results for "loadrunner" on AWS Marketplace</strong>.

   ### My image

   FUTURE:
   "HPE_LoadRunner_12-55_CE_P4_Windows-2016x64_50_Users" contains all components of
   LoadRunner 12.55 CE (a 50 user license) on a base of Windows 2016 x64.
   
   It also has loaded what HPE's images do not provide:

   * Git for Windows
   * Additional Components for VTS and Visual Studio
   * Firefox browser to emulate
   * Community Edition (CE) of Microsoft's IDE Visual Studio 2017 CE 
   * Server management utilities
   <br /><br />

   This AMI's use does not involve additional fees like HPE charges, only Amazon hourly fees. But I gladly take donations to my charity for the many hours of work figuring this out and documenting the steps here.
   
   CAUTION: This image is not "hardened" nor thoroughly tested.

   The remainder of this document describes creation and use of this image.

   Let's begin with use of the image. <a href="Rebundle">Futher down this document</a> is a description of steps to use a base image, install, and "rebundle" for your use.


   ### Images for Hewlett-Packard Enterprise

   <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B0163LX7I6/">
   "HPE_LoadRunner_12-53_P4_Windows-2012R2x64_<strong>150_Users</strong>..."</a> and<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B0163LX7I6/">
   "HPE_LoadRunner_12-53_P4_Windows-2012R2x64_<strong>1050_Users</strong>..."<br />
   contains (the older) LoadRunner 12.53 Patch 4 on Windows Server 2012 R2 2012R2 x64.

   PROTIP: Notes from HPE developers is <a target="_blank" href="https://community.saas.hpe.com/t5/LoadRunner-Practitioners-Forum/Performance-Center-LoadRunner-12-53-patch-4-was-released/td-p/554976">here as part of the Jan 4, 2017 release</a>. This link should really be among AWS EC2 documentation.

   MicroFocus has not gotten around yet to updating this for LoadRunner 12.55 under its name.

   A HP/MicroFocus Performance Center AMI is not offered.

0. Click Select on the "Free Trial" or the "Wilson Mar" image.

   CAUTION: "Free Trial</strong> refers to the 14-day grace period on what Amazon pays HPE/MicroFocus $25 per hour, which means <strong>$600 per day</strong> or $1,800 per month.

   The expiration date is displayed <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/library?ref=cns_1clkLib">here</a>.

   CAUTION: The extent it has been "hardened" for security I have not seen documented.

0. Click Continue.

0. Get to EC2 from the AWS Management Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home
0. Login with your credentials.
0. Select the Region at the upper right. For example, the N. California:

   https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-1#

0. Click the blue "Launch Instance" button.
0. Select a base image: "Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Base" (Data Center Edition). 
   It has a "Microsoft Windows 10" look and feel.

   NOTE: If you were to construct a Load Generator instead, you would instead select "Amazon Linux AMI...".

0. If you're just working on installation, select "t2.micro" because it's Free tier eligible.

   PROTIP: Select "t2.medium" with 4 GB memory if you're going to use it to do anything real.

0. Click Next: Configure Instance Details.
0. Select a VPC you've defined previously. If you haven't, open another window and do that first.
0. You don't need to with this instance. But other instances (such as for IIS servers), scroll down to expand Advanced Details to specify server start-up commands. See ["my PowerShell commands in EC2 instances"](/powershell-ec2/).
0. Click "Next: Add Storage". Defaults are for the machine chosen earlier (for t2.micro, 30 GiB, General Purpose SSD, not encrypted).

   PROTIP: Amazon's current maximum volume size that can be given to a General Purpose volume is 16GB.

0. Click "Next: Add Tags".
0. Click "Add Tag". In Key, type `Name`. In Value, type `LR1255.01` (or whatever to differentiate rather than "Web Server").

   PROTIP: This is the name that appears in the EC2 Console, which doesn't provide much room. So keep it short.

0. Click "Next: Configure Security Group". 
0. Use default "Create a new security group" and the random name created.
0. For Security Group Name, use the "RDP" port 3389 for use with Windows servers.

   NOTE: Since this is a Windows machine, SSH (via port 22) is not usually needed.

0. For its Source, select Anywhere because this is used during training by anyone.

   CAUTION: This setup is not safe to handle corporate or HSI data.

0. Click Add Rule. For its Type, select HTTP.  Leave Port as 80. For its Source, select Anywhere.
0. Click Add Rule. For its Type, select HTTPS. Leave Port as 443. For its Source, select Anywhere.

   NOTE: The LoadRunner port 54345 does not need to be specified for instances containing both Controller and Load Generator in the same server.

0. Click "Review and Launch".
0. Click "Launch".
0. Click OK to the security warning if it appears.

0. Create a new key pair. (But in Quiklab, Choose an existing one.)
0. Type a Key Pair Name with a date and your initials, such as 

   "HPE_LoadRunner_12-53_P4_Windows-2012x64_50_Users-20171001-wm" for HP
   
   "HPE_LoadRunner_12-55_CE_P4_Windows-2016x64_50_Users-20171001-wm"

0. Click Download Key Pair. <strong>.pem</strong> file. The default is your Downloads folder.
0. Click OK to the download dialog.
0. Click Lauch Instances. <strong>CAUTION: Charges now begin accumulating.</strong>.

   NOTE: A "Thank you for subscribing..." email is sent to you from AWS Marketplace &LT;no-reply-aws@amazon.com>.

   PROTIP: Immediately set an hourly alarm 50 minutes from the time stamp on the email. Amazon charges by the hour. So if you stop before the hour is up, you'll still be charged for the whole hour.

   
   ### Access server via RDP Windows

   This applies to Windows servers everywhere, not just in the AWS EC2 cloud.

0. See ["Use RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) clients to access Windows Servers"](/rdp-macos/)


   ### Configure the Windows Instance

0. Click the Windows icon and type enough of `server manager` for it to appear in the list. Click on it in the list.

   ...



### Browse the Default Web Site

### Accessing Metadata



### Stop or Terminate instance

When you're ready to ... in the EC2 Console, right-click on your instance 

   ![ec2-console-terminate-369x267-59878](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30000916-cf8b9a2a-9039-11e7-9e05-945b2d04a576.jpg)

If you select <strong>Stop</strong> of the instance, usage fees will stop. However, the root volume of the instance (EBS volume, also called "Provisioned storage") is preserved and storage charges will continue to accure. But other devices that are attached to the instance keep on running, accumulating charges.

   PROTIP: Stopping an instance enables you to change the RAM, and even instance type to a bigger or smaller machine.

   CAUTION: Starting an instance re-starts the billing clock such that if you stop and start an instance within an hour, you will be billed for two hours.

If you select <strong>Terminate</strong>, you will need to go through the steps to create a new instance. The .rdp and .pem files downloaded are no longer valid.
