This is a hands-on tutorial on the different ways to get your hands on LoadRunner 12.55.

   * <a href="#ManualInstall">Install yourself manually</a>
   * <a href="#AmazonInstall">Amazon Cloud</a>
   * TODO: <a href="#Azure">Microsoft Azure</a>
   * TODO: <a href="#GCloud">Google Cloud Compute</a>

There are different scopes of what is installed on a machine:

   * "<strong>LoadRunner VuGen</strong>" client only for use with Performance Center central web server, which presents collects and displays run results on a web page rather than via Controller and local Analysis.

   * "<strong>LoadRunner Load Generator</strong>" only for call by a separate Controller or Performance Center.    This is decribed at https://www.guru99.com/creating-amazon-ec2-instance.html
   and https://community.saas.hpe.com/t5/LoadRunner-and-Performance/Step-by-step-instructions-to-Provision-Load-Generators-in-the/ba-p/245072#.WaW1-pOGNZo

   * "<strong>LoadRunner UI</strong>" after full install of VuGen, Controller, and Analysis plus VTS and Load Generator on same machine for learning. This is the scope of this document.
   <br /><br />

Gaspare Marino, HPE Marketing, <a target="_blank" href="https://community.saas.hpe.com/t5/LoadRunner-and-Performance/Modernize-application-performance-testing-with-LoadRunner-and/ba-p/1611743">on August 30, 2017 points to version features in LoadRunner and Performance Center 12.55</a> to dispel competing vendors painting LoadRunner as a "dinosaur".

<a name="AmazonInstall"></a>

### Amazon LoadRunner UI

0. Get an Amazon account.
0. In IAM, setup a different account than your master account used for billing.

0. Get to EC2 from the AWS Management Console.
0. Click "Launch Instance".
0. Click <strong>Community AMIs</strong> and type <strong>LoadRunner</strong>.

   ![lr1253-ec2-758x394](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30002572-bf019b02-9069-11e7-98d4-600422efc495.jpg)

0. Click the <strong>4 results for "loadrunner" on AWS Marketplace</strong>.

   ### My image

   FUTURE:
   "LoadRunner_12-55_CE_Windows-2016x64_50_Users" contains all components of
   LoadRunner 12.55 CE (a 50 user license) on a base of Windows 2016 x64.
   
   It also has loaded what HPE's images do not provide:

   * Git for Windows
   * Additional Components for VTS and Visual Studio
   * Firefox browser to emulate
   * Community Edition (CE) of Microsoft's IDE Visual Studio 2017 CE 
   * Server management utilities
   <br /><br />

   This AMI's use does not involve additional fees like HPE charges, only Amazon hourly fees. But I gladly take donations to my charity for the many hours of work figuring this out and documenting the steps here.
   
   CAUTION: This image is not "hardened" nor thoroughly tested.

   The remainder of this document describes creation and use of this image.

   Let's begin with use of the image. <a href="#Rebundle">Futher down this document</a> is a description of steps to use a base image, install, and "rebundle" for your use.


   ### Images from HPE/MicroFocus

   <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B0163LX7I6/">
   "HPE_LoadRunner_12-53_P4_Windows-2012R2x64_<strong>150_Users</strong>..."</a> and<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B0163LX7I6/">
   "HPE_LoadRunner_12-53_P4_Windows-2012R2x64_<strong>1050_Users</strong>..."<br />
   contains (the older) LoadRunner 12.53 Patch 4 on Windows Server 2012 R2 2012R2 x64.

   PROTIP: Notes from HPE developers is <a target="_blank" href="https://community.saas.hpe.com/t5/LoadRunner-Practitioners-Forum/Performance-Center-LoadRunner-12-53-patch-4-was-released/td-p/554976">here as part of the Jan 4, 2017 release</a>. This link should really be among AWS EC2 documentation.

   MicroFocus has not gotten around yet to updating this for LoadRunner 12.55 under its name.

   A HP/MicroFocus Performance Center AMI is not offered.

0. Click Select on the "Free Trial" or the "Wilson Mar" image.

   CAUTION: <strong>"Free Trial</strong> refers to the 14-day grace period on what Amazon pays HPE/MicroFocus $25 per hour, which means <strong>$600 per day</strong> or $1,800 per month.

   The expiration date is displayed <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/library?ref=cns_1clkLib">here</a>.

   CAUTION: The extent it has been "hardened" for security I have not seen documented.

0. Click Continue.

0. Get to EC2 from the AWS Management Console: <a target="_blank" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home">https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home</a>
0. Login with your credentials.
0. Select the Region at the upper right. For example, the N. California:

   `https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-1#`

   <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/help/200940360">
   PROTIP</a>: If you are building a source AMI for AWS Marketplace, the region MUST be in <strong>us-east-1</strong> region. AWS Marketplace will take the source AMI and clone for other regions.

0. Click the blue "Launch Instance" button.
0. Select a base image: "Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Base" (Data Center Edition). 
   It has a "Microsoft Windows 10" look and feel.

   NOTE: If you were to construct a Load Generator instead, you would instead select "Amazon Linux AMI...".

0. If you're just working on installation, select "t2.micro" because it's Free tier eligible.

   PROTIP: Select "t2.medium" with 4 GB memory if you're going to use it to do anything real.

0. Click Next: Configure Instance Details.
0. Select a VPC you've defined previously. If you haven't, open another window and do that first.
0. You don't need to with this instance. But other instances (such as for IIS servers), scroll down to expand Advanced Details to specify server start-up commands. See ["my PowerShell commands in EC2 instances"](/powershell-ec2/).
0. Click "Next: Add Storage". Defaults are for the machine chosen earlier (for t2.micro, 30 GiB, General Purpose SSD, not encrypted).

   PROTIP: Amazon's current maximum volume size that can be given to a General Purpose volume is 16GB.

0. Click "Next: Add Tags".
0. Click "Add Tag". In Key, type `Name`. In Value, type `LR1255.01` (or whatever to differentiate rather than "Web Server").

   PROTIP: This is the name that appears in the EC2 Console, which doesn't provide much room. So keep it short.

0. Click "Next: Configure Security Group". 
0. Use default "Create a new security group" and the random name created.
0. For Security Group Name, use the "RDP" port 3389 for use with Windows servers.

   NOTE: Since this is a Windows machine, SSH (via port 22) is not usually needed.

0. For its Source, select Anywhere because this is used during training by anyone.

   CAUTION: This setup is not safe to handle corporate or HSI data.

0. Click Add Rule. For its Type, select HTTP.  Leave Port as 80. For its Source, select Anywhere.
0. Click Add Rule. For its Type, select HTTPS. Leave Port as 443. For its Source, select Anywhere.

   NOTE: The LoadRunner port 54345 does not need to be specified for instances containing both Controller and Load Generator in the same server.

0. Click "Review and Launch".
0. Click "Launch".
0. Click OK to the security warning if it appears.

0. Create a new key pair. (But in Quiklab, Choose an existing one.)
0. Type a Key Pair Name with a date and your initials, such as 

   "HPE_LoadRunner_12-53_P4_Windows-2012x64_50_Users-20171001-wm" for HP
   
   "HPE_LoadRunner_12-55_CE_Windows-2016x64_50_Users-20171001-wm"

0. Click Download Key Pair. <strong>.pem</strong> file. The default is your Downloads folder.
0. Click OK to the download dialog.
0. Click Lauch Instances. <strong>CAUTION: Charges now begin accumulating.</strong>.

   NOTE: A "Thank you for subscribing..." email is sent to you from AWS Marketplace &LT;no-reply-aws@amazon.com>.

   PROTIP: Immediately set an hourly alarm 50 minutes from the time stamp on the email. Amazon charges by the hour. So if you stop before the hour is up, you'll still be charged for the whole hour.


   
   ### Access server via RDP Windows

   This applies to Windows servers everywhere, not just in the AWS EC2 cloud.

0. See ["Use RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) clients to access Windows Servers"](/rdp/)


   ### Configure the Windows Instance

0. Refer to my ["Windows 10 client configuration page"](/windows-10-client-config/).

0. Click the Windows icon and type enough of `server manager` for it to appear in the list. Click on it in the list.

0. Click the File Explorer icon on the Task Bar. Click <strong>This PC</strong>. Notice the space remaining free:

   ![win10-folder-disk-space-263x83](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30006483-c8d8c112-90b6-11e7-8cbf-9e59f20a0790.jpg)


### Stop or Terminate instance

   PROTIP: Stopping an instance enables you to change the RAM, and even the instance type to a bigger or smaller machine.

   CAUTION: Stopping, then starting an instance re-starts the billing clock such that if you stop and start an instance within the same hour, you will be billed for two hours.

0. To stop an instance in the EC2 Console, right-click on your instance name:

   ![ec2-console-terminate-369x267-59878](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30000916-cf8b9a2a-9039-11e7-9e05-945b2d04a576.jpg)

   If you select <strong>Stop</strong> of the instance, usage fees will stop. However, the root volume of the instance (EBS volume, also called "Provisioned storage") is preserved and storage charges will continue to accure. Other devices that are attached to the instance keep on running, accumulating charges.

   You can now make an AMI of the instance just created.


0. If you select <strong>Terminate</strong>, you will need to go through the steps to create a new instance. 

   Since the .rdp file for the instance downloaded are no longer valid:

0. Delete the .rdp file from your local machine.
0. Remove the instance from your RDP client.

## Create a Vuser script in Visual Studio

<a target="_blank" href="https://lrhelp.saas.hpe.com/en/12.53/help/WebHelp/Content/VuGen/164950_t_how_to_create_vuer_script_visual_basic_CSharp.htm">HERE</a>

WARNING: LoadRunner is typically several months behind each Visual Studio release in order to come up with integrations.

1. Use Windows Explorer to view folder
   `C:\Temp\HPE LoadRunner 12.55 Community Edition\DVD\Additional Components\IDE Add-Ins Dev`

   Specific versions of Visual Studio is supported:

   * `LRVS2013IDEAddInSetup.exe` supports Visual Studio 2013.
   * `LRVS2015IDEAddInSetup.exe` supports Visual Studio 2015.
   <br /><br />

   PROTIP: Even if the latest version is not supported, you can still use Visual Studio and LoadRunenr separately.

2. Install the Visual Studio IDE add-in the version of Microsoft Visual Studio.

In Visual Studio, select the appropriate template from the Installed Templates LoadRunner VB|C++|C# .NET Vuser. Visual Studio creates a new project with one class and a template for a Vuser, and the script file, <name>.usr. The template contains three sections, Initialize, Actions, and Terminate.

The following example shows a Visual C# template:

public int Initialize()
      {
          // TO DO: Add virtual user's initialization routines
            return lr.PASS;
      }  
      public int Actions()
      {
          // TO DO: Add virtual user's business process actions
          return lr.PASS;
      }
      public int Terminate()
      {
          // TO DO: Add virtual user's termination routines
          return lr.PASS;
      }
Add code to the template, in the TODO sections.

Open the Object Browser (View menu). Expand the LoadRunner node (for example Interop.LoadRunner) to see the LoadRunner elements. Add the desired elements to your script, such as transactions, rendezvous points, and messages.

Expand the Toolbar menu, Vuser, and enhance your script with runtime settings and parameters. For more information, see the runtime settings General > Run Logic or the Parameter List Dialog Box.

Use the Vuser menu to replay the script and test its functionality.

Select Vuser > Create Load Scenario, to create a LoadRunner scenario using this .usr file.

You can also build the LoadRunner project as a DLL file, which will be saved in the same folder as the project. You can reference this DLL directly from a LoadRunner scenario.
