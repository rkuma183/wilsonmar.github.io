{% include _toc.html %}

This is a tutorial on the different ways to get hands-on with LoadRunner 12.55.

* Amazon Cloud
* <a href="#Azure">Microsoft Azure</a>
* <a href="#GCloud">Google Cloud Compute</a>

<hr />

## Amazon Cloud images

There are different types of images for a specific version of LoadRunner (12.55 at this writing):

   * "<strong>LoadRunner VuGen</strong>" client only for use with Performance Center.

   * "<strong>LoadRunner Load Generator</strong>" only for call by a separate Controller or Performance Center.    This is decribed at https://www.guru99.com/creating-amazon-ec2-instance.html
   and https://community.saas.hpe.com/t5/LoadRunner-and-Performance/Step-by-step-instructions-to-Provision-Load-Generators-in-the/ba-p/245072#.WaW1-pOGNZo

   * "<strong>LoadRunner UI</strong>" after full install of VuGen, Controller, and Analysis plus VTS and Load Generator on same machine for learning. This is the scope of this document.
   <br /><br />

<hr />


### Amazon LoadRunner UI

0. Get an Amazon account.
0. In IAM, setup a different account than your master account used for billing.

0. Get to EC2 from the AWS Management Console.
0. Click "Launch Instance".
0. Click <strong>Community AMIs</strong> and type <strong>LoadRunner</strong>.

   ![lr1253-ec2-758x394](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30002572-bf019b02-9069-11e7-98d4-600422efc495.jpg)

0. Click the <strong>4 results for "loadrunner" on AWS Marketplace</strong>.

   ### My image

   FUTURE:
   "HPE_LoadRunner_12-55_CE_P4_Windows-2016x64_50_Users" contains all components of
   LoadRunner 12.55 CE (a 50 user license) on a base of Windows 2016 x64.
   
   It also has loaded what HPE's images do not provide:

   * Git for Windows
   * Additional Components for VTS and Visual Studio
   * Firefox browser to emulate
   * Community Edition (CE) of Microsoft's IDE Visual Studio 2017 CE 
   * Server management utilities
   <br /><br />

   This AMI's use does not involve additional fees like HPE charges, only Amazon hourly fees. But I gladly take donations to my charity for the many hours of work figuring this out and documenting the steps here.
   
   CAUTION: This image is not "hardened" nor thoroughly tested.

   The remainder of this document describes creation and use of this image.

   Let's begin with use of the image. <a href="Rebundle">Futher down this document</a> is a description of steps to use a base image, install, and "rebundle" for your use.


   ### Images for Hewlett-Packard Enterprise

   <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B0163LX7I6/">
   "HPE_LoadRunner_12-53_P4_Windows-2012R2x64_<strong>150_Users</strong>..."</a> and<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B0163LX7I6/">
   "HPE_LoadRunner_12-53_P4_Windows-2012R2x64_<strong>1050_Users</strong>..."<br />
   contains (the older) LoadRunner 12.53 Patch 4 on Windows Server 2012 R2 2012R2 x64.

   MicroFocus has not gotten around to updating this for LoadRunner 12.55 under its name.

   A HP/MicroFocus Performance Center AMI is not offered.

0. Click Select on the "Free Trial" or the "Wilson Mar" image.

   CAUTION: "Free Trial</strong> refers to the 14-day grace period on what Amazon pays HPE/MicroFocus $25 per hour, which means <strong>$600 per day</strong> or $1,800 per month.

   The expiration date is displayed <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/library?ref=cns_1clkLib">here</a>.

   CAUTION: The extent it has been "hardened" for security I have not seen documented.

0. Click Continue.

0. Get to EC2 from the AWS Management Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home
0. Login with your credentials.
0. Select the Region at the upper right. For example, the N. California:

   https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-1#

0. Click the blue "Launch Instance" button.
0. Select a base image: "Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Base" (Data Center Edition). 
   It has a "Microsoft Windows 10" look and feel.

   NOTE: If you were to construct a Load Generator instead, you would instead select "Amazon Linux AMI...".

0. If you're just working on installation, select "t2.micro" because it's Free tier eligible.

   PROTIP: Select "t2.medium" with 4 GB memory if you're going to use it to do anything real.

0. Click Next: Configure Instance Details.
0. Select a VPC you've defined previously. If you haven't, open another window and do that first.
0. Scroll down to expand Advanced Details to specify server start-up commands. For example, <a target="_blank" href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/itpro/powershell/windows/servermanager/install-windowsfeature">IIS web servers need this</a> (not needed for LoadRunner):

   <pre>
&LT;powershell>
Install-WindowsFeature Web-Server -IncludeManagementTools -IncludeAllSubFeature
&LT;/powershell>
   </pre>

   <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/powershell/">
   Add this</a>:

   <pre>
&LT;powershell>
# Publish a custom metric to your Amazon CloudWatch dashboard:
$dat = New-Object Amazon.CloudWatch.Model.MetricDatum
$dat.Timestamp = (Get-Date).ToUniversalTime()
$dat.MetricName = "New Posts"
$dat.Unit = "Count"
$dat.Value = $newPostCount
Write-CWMetricData -Namespace "Usage Metrics" -MetricData $dat
Install-WindowsFeature Web-Server -IncludeManagementTools -IncludeAllSubFeature
&LT;/powershell>
   </pre>

   PROTIP: 3rd-party custom <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2-windows-user-data.html">commands</strong> can access the server's C:\ drive: 

   <pre>
&LT;script>dir > c:\test.log&LT;/script>
   </pre>

   http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2-windows-user-data.html#user-data-scripts

0. Click "Next: Add Storage". Defaults are for the machine chosen earlier (for t2.micro, 30 GiB, General Purpose SSD, not encrypted).

   PROTIP: Amazon's current maximum volume size that can be given to a General Purpose volume is 16GB.

0. Click "Next: Add Tags".
0. Click "Add Tag". In Key, type `Name`. In Value, type `LR1255.01` (or whatever to differentiate rather than "Web Server").

   PROTIP: This is the name that appears in the EC2 Console, which doesn't provide much room. So keep it short.

0. Click "Next: Configure Security Group". 
0. Use default "Create a new security group" and the random name created.
0. For Security Group Name, use the "RDP" port 3389 for use with Windows servers.

   NOTE: Since this is a Windows machine, SSH (via port 22) is not usually needed.

0. For its Source, select Anywhere because this is used during training by anyone.

   CAUTION: This setup is not safe to handle corporate or HSI data.

0. Click Add Rule. For its Type, select HTTP. Leave Port as 80. For its Source, select Anywhere.
0. Click Add Rule. For its Type, select HTTPS. Leave Port as 443. For its Source, select Anywhere.

   NOTE: The LoadRunner port 54345 does not need to be specified for instances containing both Controller and Load Generator in the same server.

0. Click "Review and Launch".
0. Click "Launch".
0. Click OK to the security warning if it appears.

   NOTE: You'll get a "Thank you for subscribing..." email from AWS Marketplace &LT;no-reply-aws@amazon.com>.

0. Create a new key pair. (But in Quiklab, Choose an existing one.)
0. Type a Key Pair Name with a date and your initials, such as 

   "HPE_LoadRunner_12-53_P4_Windows-2012x64_50_Users-20171001-wm" for HP
   
   "HPE_LoadRunner_12-55_CE_P4_Windows-2016x64_50_Users-20171001-wm"

0. Click Download Key Pair. <strong>.pem</strong> file. The default is your Downloads folder.
0. Click OK to the download dialog.
0. Click Lauch Instances. CAUTION: Charges now begin accumulating.
0. Click View Instances.
0. Scroll down to copy the <strong>IPv4 Public IP</strong> such as 54.219.170.140

### Access server via RDP Windows

<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/connecting_to_windows_instance.html?icmpid=docs_ec2_console">
   Amazon's instructions</a>

0. Click the "Connect" icon at the top of the Console.

   ![ec2-connect-to-instance-677x409-140476](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30000812-04e7bd88-9036-11e7-9509-506a9192be03.jpg)

1. Click "Download Remote Desktop File" such as:

   `ec2-54-219-170-140.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com.rdp`

0. Double-click on the file to open the RDP client.

   Back to the dialog:

0. Click "Get Password".
0. Click "Browse..." and select Downloads, the .pem file downloaded earlier.
0. Click "Decrypt Password". 
0. Double-click on it to highlight it and press Ctrl+C to copy the string to your Windows Clipboard.
0. Open a Notepad file and paste it there so you won't lose it.
0. Click "Close" to dismiss the dialog.

   ### RDP Client

0. On the RDP client, click on the Password input field and paste the Clipboard contents.
0. Leave the Domain blank and click OK to connect.


### Configure the Windows Instance

1. Click the Windows icon and type enough of `server manager` for it to appear in the list. Click on it in the list.

   ...



### Browse the Default Web Site

### Accessing Metadata



### Stop or Terminate instance

When you're ready to ... in the EC2 Console, right-click on your instance 

   ![ec2-console-terminate-369x267-59878](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30000916-cf8b9a2a-9039-11e7-9e05-945b2d04a576.jpg)

If you select <strong>Stop</strong> of the instance, usage fees will stop. However, the root volume of the instance (EBS volume, also called "Provisioned storage") is preserved and storage charges will continue to accure. But other devices that are attached to the instance keep on running, accumulating charges.

   PROTIP: Stopping an instance enables you to change the RAM, and even instance type to a bigger or smaller machine.

   CAUTION: Starting an instance re-starts the billing clock such that if you stop and start an instance within an hour, you will be billed for two hours.

If you select <strong>Terminate</strong>, you will need to go through the steps to create a new instance. The .rdp and .pem files downloaded are no longer valid.
