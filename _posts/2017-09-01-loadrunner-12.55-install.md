This is a hands-on tutorial on the different ways to get your hands on LoadRunner 12.55.

   * <a href="#ManualInstall">Install yourself manually</a>
   * <a href="#AmazonInstall">Amazon Cloud</a>
   * TODO: <a href="#Azure">Microsoft Azure</a>
   * TODO: <a href="#GCloud">Google Cloud Compute</a>

There are different scopes of what is installed on a machine:

   * "<strong>LoadRunner VuGen</strong>" client only for use with Performance Center central web server, which presents collects and displays run results on a web page rather than via Controller and local Analysis.

   * "<strong>LoadRunner Load Generator</strong>" only for call by a separate Controller or Performance Center.    This is decribed at https://www.guru99.com/creating-amazon-ec2-instance.html
   and https://community.saas.hpe.com/t5/LoadRunner-and-Performance/Step-by-step-instructions-to-Provision-Load-Generators-in-the/ba-p/245072#.WaW1-pOGNZo

   * "<strong>LoadRunner UI</strong>" after full install of VuGen, Controller, and Analysis plus VTS and Load Generator on same machine for learning. This is the scope of this document.
