## Useful tools, not just toys and games

<img alt="MORE FEATURES OF LESS STRESS" width="650" height="552" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/20648066/1d9b085c-b45a-11e6-9970-86ae82498db0.png"></a>

What train people to build things
that help others save time and money, safely.

The unique aspect of our curriculum is that you
create complete <strong>products consumers buy</strong>
to plug in and simply work for them.

We provide all that you need.
Instructions. Equipment. Quality controls.

Rather than starting by messing with toys and games,
we connect to <strong>enterprise clouds</strong>
in a secure way.


## Start from examples, not blank stares

Rather than starting by memorizing code from scratch,
you run <strong>pre-programmed</strong>
automation scripts that perform the steps,
then make changes to 
see the impact and troubleshoot.
This is what happens on real jobs,
which is the purpose of this curriculum.

NOTE: Even though all manual steps are specified in training materials, 
participants experienced with Linux commands and programming experience will 
have an easier time than those who do not.


## Hands-on step-by-step training

Curriculum materials include 
<strong>step-by-step tutorial guidebooks</strong>
with pro tips, quizzes, and video diagrams.

Among the steps, 
we instill habits for good safety and vigilent security
necessary at today's enterprises.



## Reliable products, not elegant code

Testing for reliability and adequate performance
is emphasized here over tricky algorithms not used.

Programming of Python code, shell scripts, and 
JavaScript with Node is learned by examining examples
and discussion about <strong>automated code checking rules</strong>.
This is how professional programmers work.

Quality assurance is an integral part of the curriculum,
to ensure that everything just works for the consumer.

## Customer training and service

A key differentiator with our school is that students are trained 
to explain to customers in plain language
how to use products constructed.

We also ensure that our graduates apply the latest techniques for
excellent customer service and fast turnaround.
That includes training in effective use of social media.


## Products and Curriculum

In the class, each learner is provided with everything except a laptop:
a Raspberry Pi 3 B board 
with power adapter and two 32 GB class 10 SD chips.
A router is available during classes.
