## Useful tools people buy

Our objective is to make innovations available to the public
by putting together teams that make things for sale.

We want to make things that make a difference,
products that help people and organizations save time and money, safely.

Below are ideas for various products, with an outline for how to put them together.

The products are sequenced in rough order of production capability (maturity).

<a name="SDCards"></a>

### PRODUCT 1 - Configured SD cards

MAKE FOR SALE: A SD card to run your Raspberry Pi customized with the utilities and
applications you need (and without junk you don't).

available are self-running diagnistics and libraries for 
running programs using Linux Bash, Python, Node, Mono, and other utilities.
Two cards in case one goes bad.
