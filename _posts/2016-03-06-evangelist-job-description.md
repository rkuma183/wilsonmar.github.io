This is an example of a job description for a {{ page.role }}. 

This is also an example of how variables can be used in the markup text residing in GitHub,
so that key words can be changed in one place and be applied to all instances in the document.

The author of this page added variables in the header at the top of the authoring file which is not presented to readers. Within the body of the article's text is inserted <tt>{{ page.targets }}</tt>. When Jekyll reads this markup to generates HTML, it substitutes the variable with the data value from the header.

<tt>
