Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in 2016:

> "Machine learning is a core, transformative way by which we’re rethinking how we’re doing everything. We are thoughtfully applying it across all our products, be it search, ads, YouTube, or Play. And we’re in early days, but you will see us — in a systematic way — apply machine learning in all these areas."

Machine learning is a type of AI (Artificial Intelligence) 
that enables computers to do things without 
being explicitly programmed by human developers. 
Rather than explicit programming, Machine Learning algorithms identify 
rules through "training” based on many examples.

Computers are also dealing with less structured data than before, such as
(natural language text, images, and videos)
rather than neat rows in tables.


## Skill-building from games

In 1997, when Deep Blue beat world chess champion Gary Kasparov, 
it did so by "brute force", by using a supercomputer to 
analyze the outcome of every possible move, looking further ahead than any human possibly could.

In 2016, IBM's Watson software beat top Jeopardy game champions
by "learning" from books and encyclopedias. 
IBM only created the program that enables the computer to learn.
The software makes use of a "model" from <strong>example</strong> 
inputs to make predictions
vs. following strictly static program instructions (logic defined by human developers).

In 2017, the top ranked player in the Chinese game Go was
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/business/google-deepmind-alphago-go-champion-defeat.html">
defeated by Google's AlphaGo</a>, which is based on Google's DeepMind acquisition.
The software made moves that many considered illogical.
BTW, Go is considered the most complex game ever invented.
Whereas chess players have, at any given turn, an average of 35 possible moves,
on a Go board's 19-by-19 grid, there are 250 possible moves. 

Also in 2017, all top-ranked poker players were
<a target="_blank" href="http://time.com/4656011/artificial-intelligence-ai-poker-tournament-libratus-cmu/">
bested by software named Libratus from Tuomas Sandholm at CMU</a>.
The software adjusted its strategies during the tournament.
And its algorithms for strategy and negotiation are game-independent, 
meaning they're not just about poker, but a range of adversarial problems.

## Algorithms

Use of hard-coded (static) "rules" crafted by human programmers is
called "symbolic AI", used in "expert systems" fashionable during the 1980s.

Machine learning <strong>algorithms</strong> identify information from data fed through 
"generic" (general purpose) algorithms which <strong>build their own logic</strong> from detecting <em>patterns</em> within the data.

Patterns are recognized by neural network algorithms. This cycle of "learning" is implicit in a definition of Machine Learning by Mitchell (in 1997): "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E".

The "network" in a neural network has multiple "layers" or data-processing modules that "distill" data.
Models using a small number of layers are called "shallow learning”.
GoogleNet in 2014 used 22 layers. In 2016, one network uses over 1,000 layers.

By contrast, the human brain has 300 million modules that recognize patterns,
each having 100 neurons.

At the input layer, 
the network trains on a specific set of "features" 
and then sends that information to the next layer. 
That next layer combines previous conclusions with other features and passes it to the next layer, and so on, sequentially.

![ml-model-google-878x356-61242](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30997127-ee8083b6-a482-11e7-8b7a-0dd4ea518fdc.jpg)
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/serverless-machine-learning-gcp/lecture/3kcXm/what-is-machine-learning-ml">*</a>

Models are trained using examples so they can be used to make predictions. The result of training is a mathematical <strong>model</strong> used to make <strong>predictions</strong>, such as taking an unlabled photo and deriving the label "cat".


## Terminology

An example of the last layer which presents the output/decision 
(from recognizing what number is written down in a photo from the MNIST collection)
is a 10-way "softmax" layer returning an array of 10 probability scores (all summing to 1).
Each of the 10 contains the probability that the digit image belongs to one of 
10 digit <strong>classes</strong>.

Machine learning uses some terms that have alternate meanings for words also used by traditional programmers and statisticians:

* Data points are called "samples". 

* A "category" of a classification problem is called a <strong>class</strong>.
   For example, when classifying pictures, "puppy" and "muffin" are two of the classes.
   Each class describes a set of possible labels to choose from.

* A <strong>"label"</strong> is a specific instance of a class.
   A label can be an answer for a prediction task ­--
­   either the answer produced by a machine learning
   system, or the right answer supplied in training data. 

* (In statistics, a "target" is called a dependent variable.)
   In machine learning, a target is also called a label,
   what a model should ideally have predicted, 
   according to an external source of data.

* The <strong>prediction error</strong>, also called <strong>loss value</strong>,
  the measure of the distance between a model’s prediction and the target.
   
  It's a <strong>metric</strong> of measurements that you care about, 
  which may or may not be directly optimized.

* An <strong>instance</strong> is the aspect about which you want to make a prediction. 
   (An instance is called an "objective" in other fields.)

* A <strong>feature</strong> is a property of an instance used in a prediction task. 
   For example, a web page might
   have a feature "contains the word 'cat'".
   A feature in machine learning is called a "variable" in statistics.
   (Feature creation in machine learning is called a "transformation" in statistics.)

* A <strong>feature Column</strong> is a set of related features, 
   such as the set of all possible countries in which users might live. 
   An example may have one or more features present in a feature column. A
   feature column is referred to as a “namespace” in the VW system (at Yahoo/Microsoft), or a field.
   Example: An instance (with its features) and a label.

* An <strong>objective</strong> is a metric that an algorithm is trying to optimize.

* A <strong>pipeline</strong> is the infrastructure surrounding a machine learning algorithm. A particular pipeline can include:

   1. gathering the data from the front end, 
   2. putting it into training data files, 
   3. training one or more models, and
   4. exporting the models to production.

## Types of machine learning

### Supervised learning 

The supervised learning approach aims to predict an output given an input
by making use of a <strong>labeled</strong> data set of training data (examples) 
to which we know the "answer" or <strong>target</strong>. 
It gets feedback on what is correct or not. 
The training correlates features 
to outputs in order to predict outputs based on new inputs.

   * For time series analysis, use a "recurrent net".
   Recurrent nets process data that changes with time,
   using a feedback loop that acts as a forecasting engine.
   
   Recurrent networks have a network topology in which data flow itself is recycled. 
   It is used, for example, to generate sequences of words from the vectors describing the "meaning" of pictures. Each word depends on all that have already been produced. 

   * For text processing (Sentiment Analysis) 
   and speech recognition: use a
   Recurrent Net or a 
   RNTN (Recursive Neural Tensor Network)
   that operates at individual character level.   
   RNTNs were conceived by Richard Socher of 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://metamind.io/">
   MetaMind.io</a> as part of his PhD thesis at Stanford.
   In 2016 it became part of Salesforce Einstein Predictive Services at
   https://metamind.readme.io/v1/docs

   RNTNs are better than feed-forward or recurrent nets with
   data with a hierarchical structure (binary trees), 
   such as the parse trees of a group of sentences.

   * For image (object) recognition is DBN (Deep Belief Network) or 
   Convolutional Net. 

   <strong>Convolution</strong> means use of the same filter (also called a "kernel") 
   across the whole image, just like use of a filter in Photoshop.﻿
   <a target="_blank" href="https://clarifai.com/">
   Clarifai</a> uses a convolutional net to recognize things and concepts in a digital image.
   It then presents similar images.

   Kernel methods are a group of algorithms for classification.
   <strong>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</strong>
   being the best known from Vapnik and Cortes in the early 1990s at Bell Labs and Vapnik and Chervonenkis as early as 1963.
   SVM classifies by finding in training data "decision boundaries" between sets of points belonging to different categories. Classifying new data points involves checking which side of the decision boundary they fall on.

Used in both feed-forward and (unrolled) recurrent networks is
<strong>
Backpropagation</strong> to update weights so networks learn (improve).
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB_-LabED68">*</a>
The Deep Visualization Toolkit illustrates the intermediate process.


### Unsupervised learning #

The "unsupervised" part of unsupervised learning 
means it makes use of a dataset without labels. 

It uses "feature extraction" to discover a good internal representation of the input. 
It identifies the structure of data to solve some given task.

It uses "Pattern recognition" to <strong>classify</strong> patterns and clusters data.

   * Autoencoders encode their own structure.
   They are feature extractors with the same number of input and output nodes.

   A hidden layer in Autoencoders provides a bottleneck
   of nodes reconstruction of input layer.
   So they can be used for image compression.

   * RBM (Restricted Boltzmann Machine) is an autoencoder
   with one visible and one hidden layer.
   Each visible node connects to all nodes in the hidden layer.

   The "restricted" is because there is no connection among nodes within its layer.

   RBM is like a two-way translator.
   RBM determines the relationship among input features.

   In training loops,
   RBM reconstructs inputs in the backward pass.

   RBM uses a measure called "KL Divergence" that compares actual to recreation of data.
   RBM makes decisions about what features are important based on weights and 
   overall bias.

   All this means that data in
   RBM does not need to be labeled.

   As an example, to determine whether an animal is acerous or not acerous (has horns), it
   look at features such as color, number of legs, horns.

   "Principal Component Analysis" is a widely used linear method for finding
   a low-dimensional representation.

### Reinforcement learning 

Reinforcement learning does not provide feedback until a goal is achieved.
Its objective is to select an action to maximize payoff.

In Dec 2013, Volodymyr Mnih and others at 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.deepmind.com/">
DeepMind.com</a> (a small company in London)
uploaded to Arxiv a paper titled
<a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602">
“Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning”</a>. 
The paper describes how a "convolutional neural network" program 
learned to play several games on the Atari 2600 console (Pong, Breakout, SpaceInvaders, Seaquest, Beam Rider)
by observing raw screen pixels of 210 × 160. 
The program learned by receiving a reward when the game score increased. 
<a name="GeneralAI"></a>
This was hailed as "general AI" because the games and the goals in every game were very different but, without any change, learned seven different games, and performed better than some humans in three of them. 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.nervanasys.com/demystifying-deep-reinforcement-learning/">
*</a> 
Their 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236">
Feb. 2015 article in Nature</a> gave them widespread attention.
Then Google bought DeepMind (for $400 million).

### Transfer learning

   * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx6Wv_SCKjI&index=16&list=PLjJh1vlSEYgvZ3ze_4pxKHNh1g5PId36-

### One-shot learning

(aka Probabilistic Programming) 
is where a neural network 
learns from one (or a few) examples, 
as opposed to a large amount of data.

<a name="DeepLearning"></a>

### Deep Learning

"Deep learning" is a specific subfield of machine learning. 
The "deep" in "deep learning" is not about "deeper” understanding, but 
about the depth of various filters in a multi-stage information distillation operation. 
Each stage extracts some meaning from different representations of the input. 

Deep learning learns 
all layers of representation "greedily", in parallel at the same time, 
rather than each layer in succession.
Intermediate incremental representations are learned jointly.
Each layer is updated to follow the representational needs of layers both 
above and below itself.

## Data representation

Tensors generalize matrices to an arbitrary number of axes (3 or more "dimensions").

A tensor that contains only one number is called a <strong>"scalar"</strong> 
(aka "scalar tensor"), also called a <strong>"0D tensor"</strong> because
in Numpy the `ndim` attribute of a scalar tensor has 0 axis (ndim == 0).
(Yes, it confuses axis with dimensions)

An array (list) of several numbers is called a <strong>vector</strong> 
or <strong>1D tensor</strong> having one axis. 
As Lecun explains it:

   A vector of 5 entries is called a "5-dimensional vector". 
   Do not confuse a 5-dimensional vector with a 5D tensor! 
   A 5D vector has only one axis and has 5 dimensions along its axis, 
   while a 5D tensor has 5 axes (and may have any number of dimensions along each axis).

An array of vectors is a matrix, or <strong>2D tensor</strong> of two axes.

   <pre>
x = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
              [10, 11, 12, 13, 14],
              [100, 101, 102, 103, 104]])
   </pre>

Each vertical "column" is like a variable. The first one has values 1, 10, and 100 from the three lines (rows), which are akin to a set of observations for a particular point in time.

The "shape" of the above is (3,5) for 3 vectors each containing 5 values.

A <strong>3D tensor</strong> is defined as a "cube" of numbers.
The MNIST library of 60,000 sample images, each consisting of 28x28 black-and-white pixels
(each pixel represented by a number range from white to black),
has a <strong>shape</strong> of (60000,28,28).

4D tensors are used to process matrices of color pictures :<br />
(samples, width, height, channels)

5D tensors are used when processing video data:<br />
(samples, frames, width, height, color_depth).

In Python Numpy, a data type of "float32" or "float64" is a scalar tensor (or scalar array).

"Selecting" specific elements in a tensor is called "tensor slicing".

### Axies for Shape

2D tensors containing simple vector data of shape (samples, features)
are typically processed in "fully-connected" ("densely-connected" or "dense") layers 
using the Dense class in Keras. 

3D tensors containing sequence data of shape (samples, timesteps, features)
are typically processed by "recurrent" layers such as a LSTM layer. 

4D tensors containing image data is typically processed by Convolution2D layers.

5D tensors containing video data use the reshape layer.
See https://github.com/anayebi/keras-extra
for using Extra Layers for Keras to connect a RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) by allowing the CNN layers to be time distributed.


### Pandas

The Padas Python library reads databases directly into
<a title="[38:15] Charles Givre at Metis 20170720" target="_blank" href="https://livestream.com/metis/events/7594894/videos/160063655">these Pandas structures</a>:

| Dimensions | Name | Description |
| ---------- | ---- | ----------- |
| 1 | "Series" | Indexed 1 dimension data structure |
| 2 | "Timeseries" | Series using time stamps as an index |
| 3 | "DataFrame" | A two-dimensional table |
| 4 | "Panel" | A three-dimensional table data structure |


* A <strong>scalar regression task</strong> is one where the target is a continuous scalar value. 
   For example, when predicting house prices, the different target prices form a continuous space.

* A <strong>vector regression task</strong> is one where the target is a set of continuous values
  (e.g. a continuous vector) while doing regression against multiple values (e.g. the coordinates of a bounding box in an image).


## Metrics

The goal is to derive models that generalize.

When using its training data, a <strong>"loss function"</strong> 
is used to measure how well a neural network layer meets its objective. 
Thus, some call it an "objective function".

It is called a function because it's the result of changes, and thus used to
determine whether changes are moving in the right direction.
Changes are made to minimize the loss function.

The number of data values is typically split into a 
training set, a validation set, and a test set. This is so we don't evaluate data
using what was used for training in order to avoid overfitting.

An <strong>"optimizer"</strong> is the mechanism a network uses to update itself 
(based on data received and loss function values).
It implements a specific variant for <strong>stochastic gradient descent</strong>.


## Gradient Boosting

To address shallow learning problems, 
where structured data is available, 
"gradient boosting machines" have been used.

Practitioners of gradient boosting make use of the XGB library, 
which supports both the two most popular languages of data science: Python and R.
