<hr />

{% include _toc.html %}

This is a quick step-by-step introduction to the Go programming language (GoLang).

<hr />

Go is an opinionated language:

   * Compiler doesn't issue warnings, just errors
   * Unused local variables are an error
   * fmt (an contraction of "format", pronounced "frumpt") is Go's single way to format output

Like C:

   * Strongly typed (must specify data type in commands)
   * Used by developers of C (Kernigan, who literally wrote the book on C)
   * Uses its own compiler to create itself

Unlike C:

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/1">
   Go has no pointer arithmetic</a>

Like both Java and C:

   * needs to be built by a compiler (not interpreted like Python)
   * double slashes for comments

Like Java:

   * Is memory safe by default
   * Networking is baked into the standard library and runtime
   * Collects garbage

Unlike both:

   * fast compile to native code
   * low GC pause (100 microseconds)
   * Memory is zeroed if not explicitly initialized
   * there are no parentheses surrounding the three components of the 
   <a href="#for">for statement</a> 

<hr />

## Install Compiler

0. If there was a previous version installed:

   On a Mac:

   <tt><strong>brew uninstall go
   </strong></tt>

   The response, for example:

   <pre>Uninstalling /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.8... (7,017 files, 281.6MB)
   </pre>

0. Use third-party software installers so new versions can be managed automatically.

   If you use Homebrew on your Mac, install on any folder using:

   <tt><strong>brew install go
   </strong></tt>

   (go or golang can be specified)

   Alternately, MacPorts:

   <pre>sudo port install go
   </pre>

   Alternately, do what the GoLang web page says: download installer from: 

   <a target="_blank" href="https://golang.org/dl/">
   https://golang.org/dl</a>

   storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.7.4.darwin-amd64.pkg 

0. Consider a paid, commercially supported, quality-assured Go distribution
   for big data, database connectivity, code quality, microservices/cloud development:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.activestate.com/activego">
   https://www.activestate.com/activego</a>

   NOTE: This was in "beta" as of April, 2017.

0. See where the Go command references:

   <tt><strong>go version
   </strong></tt>

   shows (at time of writing):

   <pre>go version go1.8.3 darwin/amd64
   </pre>

0. To upgrade to the latest:

   <tt><strong>brew upgrade go
   </strong></tt>


   ### Source files folder

0. In an internet browser (Chrome or Firefox):

   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wilsonmar/golang-samples">
   https://github.com/wilsonmar/golang-samples</a>

   Its contents is <a href="#MyCodeSamples">described here below</a>.

   Alternately,<br />
   https://github.com/mkaz/working-with-go/

0. Fork the sample repository to your own GitHub account.

0. Switch to a Terminal shell window.

0. Create a folder to hold various Git repositories (personal preference here, 
   replace gits and wilsonmar with your account name):

   <pre>cd ~
   mkdir gits
   cd gits
   mkdir wilsonmar
   cd wilsonmar
   </pre>

0. Edit (~/.bash_profile on Macs) to create $GOPATH (replacing wilsonmar with your 
   GitHub account name):

   <pre>export GOHOME="$HOME/gits/wilsonmar/golang-samples"
   </pre>

   Alternately, append by using this command:

   echo "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin" >> ~/.bash_profile

0. Navigate to the default home folder.

   <pre>cd $GOHOME</pre>

0. Pull down from GitHub:

   <tt><strong>git clone https://github.com/wilsonmar/golang-samples
   </strong></tt>

   PROTIP: Go source code files exist within a folder of the same name and have a suffix of .go. 

0. Verify by getting the environment settings:

   <tt><strong>go env
   </strong></tt>

   shows (at time of writing), on a Mac:

   <pre>
GOARCH="amd64"
GOBIN=""
GOEXE=""
GOHOSTARCH="amd64"
GOHOSTOS="darwin"
GOOS="darwin"
GOPATH="/Users/mac/gits/wilsonmar/golang-samples"
GORACE=""
GOROOT="/usr/local/Cellar/go/1.8.1/libexec"
GOTOOLDIR="/usr/local/Cellar/go/1.8.1/libexec/pkg/tool/darwin_amd64"
GCCGO="gccgo"
CC="clang"
GOGCCFLAGS="-fPIC -m64 -pthread -fno-caret-diagnostics -Qunused-arguments -fmessage-length=0 -fdebug-prefix-map=/var/folders/j_/gh27gpxj1t58hyryfg9drvdc0000gn/T/go-build434742939=/tmp/go-build -gno-record-gcc-switches -fno-common"
CXX="clang++"
CGO_ENABLED="1"
PKG_CONFIG="pkg-config"
CGO_CFLAGS="-g -O2"
CGO_CPPFLAGS=""
CGO_CXXFLAGS="-g -O2"
CGO_FFLAGS="-g -O2"
CGO_LDFLAGS="-g -O2"
   </pre>

   NOTE: GOROOT is in Cellar because it was installed by Homebrew.

   No need to define $GOROOT in ~/.bash_profile unless Go was downloaded to a custom location.

   ### Help

0. Verify whether you can do Go commands:

   <tt><strong>go help | more
   </strong></tt> 

   Go displays help as a page in your default text editor.

   PROTIP: If you don't pipe to more, you'll see the bottom of the document and have
   to page back up. 

0. If you see a colon at the lower-left corner:

   * press spacebar to page down
   * press `q` to quit.


   ### Auto format

   PROTIP: Many developers type code from the first character because they let
   formatters automatically take care of proper indentation.

0. Format source code according to Go coding standards using the standard
   format:

   <tt><strong>go fmt ./...
   </strong></tt> 

   The three dots specify recursion down the current folder.

   Alternately use the formatter from 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/">
   https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/">
   which has flags for more control:

   <tt><strong>go gofmt [flags] [path ...]
   </strong></tt> 




   ### GoImports

0. Install and configuring goimports to automatically run on save
   to format and auto adjust import statements as needed:

   <pre>go get code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/goimports
   </pre>

   BLAH: I'm getting these messages:

   <pre>
package code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/goimports: unrecognized import path "code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/goimports" (parse https://code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/goimports?go-get=1: no go-import meta tags (meta tag github.com/golang/go did not match import path code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/goimports))
   </pre>   

0. Setup vim to auto run goimports on save using vim-go:

   <pre>let g:go_fmt_command = "goimports"
   </pre>

   BLAH: Response is "-bash: let: g:go_fmt_command: syntax error in expression (error token is ":go_fmt_command")"

0. Setup reload web server when file change is detected:

   https://github.com/shenfeng/http-watcher

   https://bitbucket.org/gotamer/gowatch   

   https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin "Gin" web framework


   ### IDEs to edit/run Go

   Unlike C#, Go is not associated with an IDE such as Microsoft Visual Studio.
   However, shortcuts and reformat are provided for text editors:

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RS7LyBt8aA">
   Atom Golang video</a> by Todd McLeod

   * WebStorm 
   Gogland from JetBrains, who made IntelliJ for Java, PyCharm, etc.

   * TextMate 2 has a Go bundle at http://macromates.com/download

   * vim has a vim-go package at https://github.com/fatih/vim-go

   * SublimeText?

   * Visual Studio Code?


   ### File Issue for Go on GitHub

0. To create a new bug (issue) by opening GitHub from your command line:

   <pre><strong>go bug</strong></pre>

   This opens a browser window on Go's GitHub page at<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/golang/go">
   https://github.com/golang/go</a>
   
   Go's repo was previously in Mercurial.


## Who uses Go?

Although unveiled in 2009, companies who have adopted Go in their products include
Atlassian, Docker, Facebook, DigitalOcean, Cloudflare, eBay, Heroku, Hashicorp, Capital One.

<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.golang.org/survey2016-results">
The 2016 survey</a> found that 40% of respondants used the language for less that 1 year.

The greatest use is in runnable/interactive programs (CLI).

When asked what they like most about Go, users most commonly mentioned Go’s simplicity, ease of use, concurrency features, and performance.

When asked what changes would most improve Go, users most commonly mentioned generics, package versioning, and dependency management. Other popular responses were GUIs, debugging, and error handling.

Go isn’t an appropriate fit for iOS, JS.

The Go compiler is programmed in Go itself rather than C.
<a target="_blank" href="https://dave.cheney.net/2013/06/04/how-go-uses-go-to-build-itself">*</a>
This means Go installers don't have dependencies like Java and Python programs.

Due to its small size, Go can be a good fit for use on a Raspberry Pi small computer
to receive and provide small amounts of data. ?

PROTIP: The canonical list of companies using Go is at<br />
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GoUsers">
https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GoUsers</a>



## Hello World Code in Go Playground

PROTIP: Like Python has "Pythonic", "Gothic" is Go's way of saying idiomatic Go code
(the easiest and most common ways of accomplishing a task using native language constructs rather than porting assumptions from a different language).

0. View a simple Go program in an on-line editor for Go at <a target="_blank" href="https://play.golang.org/p/0Hz57BQdTA">https://play.golang.org/p/0Hz57BQdTA</a> 

   <pre>
// hello.go
package main
import( "fmt"; "time")
var now = time.Now()
func main() {
    fmt.Printf("hello, world at %v",now)
}
   </pre>

   Notice no semicolons at the end of each line.

   The response printed out is the default time format is of the time of Go's initial commit:

   <pre>
   2009-11-10 23:00:00 UTC
   1257894000 epoch time
   </pre>

## Add Packages Imported

### Path of Packages in $GOPATH

An alternative way to specify 3rd-party libraries:

<pre>
import (
  "testing"
  "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
)
</pre>

If you get error message "cannot find package" when running a go program,
try the procedure below.

NOTE: Go looks for packages first within the folder where you installed Go.
If you installed using Homebrew, that would be like:

  <pre>/usr/local/Cellar/go/1.8.1/libexec/src/github.com/stretchr/testify/assert</pre>

   (from $GOROOT)

   PROTIP: Don't install packages under where Go is installed.
   This is so you won't have problems after you upgrade to the next version.

0. Create a <tt>$HOME/gopkgs</tt> folder to store 3rd party Go packages in one place.

   <tt><strong>cd ~<br />
   mkdir gopkgs<br />
   cd gopkgs
   </strong></tt>

0. Create a $GOPATH environment variable to store a list of folders containing Go programs,
   separate by semicolons. In my ~/.bash_profile:

   <pre>export GOPATH=$HOME/gopkgs</pre>

   There can be a list in the path, separated by colons in Linux/Mac.
   Go searches each directory listed in GOPATH to find source code.

   CAUTION: New packages are always downloaded into the first directory in the list.

   See https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH

0. Close Terminal and start it again, or 

   <tt><strong>source ~/.bash_profile
   </strong></tt>

0. Get a package from below. For example:

   <tt><strong>go get github.com/stretchr/testify
   </strong></tt>

   If nothing is returned, that's a good sign.

   If there isn't one, Go will have created a <strong>src</strong> folder.

   NOTE: The pkg folder holds installed package objects, such as "linux_amd64".

   Also, within src is created a <strong>github.com</strong> folder.

   NOTE: Other "collaboration platforms" like GitHub include:

   * launchpad.net
   * bitbucket.com
   * gitlab.com
   <br /><br />

   For each 3rd-party library is
   created a folder for each GitHub user. For example, stretchr.

   <tt><strong>cd ~/gopkgs/src/github.com<br />
   mkdir stretchr<br />
   cd stretchr
   </strong></tt>

   Go get does the equivalent of cloning a package repo from GitHub.
   The manual equivalent of that is:

   <pre><strong>git clone https://github.com/stretchr/testify --depth=1
   </strong></pre>

0. Compile to binary executables all files in current folder to $GOPATH/bin :

   <tt><strong>cd $GOPATH<br />
   go install .
   </strong></tt>

0. Create a folder to store your own Go programs. For me, I have a repository on GitHub:
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wilsonmar/golang-samples">
   https://github.com/wilsonmar/golang-samples</a>

   I've cloned that to my local folder at:

   <pre>$HOME/gits/wilsonmar/golang-samples</pre>



## Install apps

To install the Go package for reading from continously updated files (tail -f)

   <pre><strong>
go get <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/arschles/go-in-5-minutes/tree/master/episode0">github.com/arschles/go-in-5-minutes/tree/master/episode0</a>
   </strong></pre>

   * PROTIP: There is no "http://" in front of github.com when getting go packages.

   * This repo is described in videos at

## My Code Samples

0. Download or git clone my code samples for the Go language is at<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wilsonmar/golang-samples/">
   https://github.com/wilsonmar/golang-samples</a>

0. Open a Terminal shell window and give the files execute permissions:

   <pre>chmod 555 * </pre>

   ### hello-time.go template

0. cd to <strong>hello-time</strong>, which I use as the basis for creating new files.

   * print the elasped time of the program run.
   * define a date
   * calculate days from hours
   * format dates based on a template
   * see https://coderwall.com/p/l7e3fq/golang-time-function-wrapper

0. A line at the top of the file enables it to be optionally run as a shell sript:

   <tt><strong>./hello-temp.go
   </strong></tt>

0. Run it as a program:

   <tt><strong>go run hello-time.go
   </strong></tt>

0. Build it

   <tt><strong>go build
   </strong></tt>

   A file with no file extension should appear in the folder on Linux.
   Extension .exe is added on Windows machines.

   When compiling packages, build ignores files that end in '_test.go'.

   To build an executable for running on other operating systems:

   <pre>GOOS=openbsd go build
   GOOS=windows GOARCH=386 go build
   </pre>

0. Run the executable on Linux or mac:

   <tt><strong>./hello-time
   </strong></tt>

   Alternately, on Windows, run the executable:

   <tt><strong>hello-time.exe
   </strong></tt>

   PROTIP: All Go programs must be part of a package.
   main is the default package.

   * Global variable - start time.
   * Four character indent. gofmt indents using tabs that take 8 characters.


   ### For Multiple Operating systems
   
0. View multi-platform.go


   ### Random number generator
   
0. <strong>rand.go</strong>

   * Import flag to obtain arguments from command line
   * Reflection of elasped time is not appropriate here because it is intended to run as a utility.
   * Defined in a main plus separate utility functions.
   * Loop the number of repeats specified.
   * Slice of an integer array containing prime numbers. See https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/8 Notice there can be a ending comma after the last item in the list.
   This avoids one of the most annoying error messages in other languages.
   * Pointer

   ### Loop until manually stopped

   Within a main infinite loop:

   <pre>
func main() {
  var input string
  for {
  fmt.Scanln(&input)
  }
}
   </pre>

0. <strong>switch</strong>

   * Print command to construct a line printed over several command lines
   * Recognize operating system being used by using "runtime.GOOS".

0. <strong>strings</strong>

   * One Println with several commands.

0. <strong>latlong</strong>

   It manages latitudes and longitudes in a map data type containing a key-value structure.

   * Uses float64 floating point number for latitude/longitude
   * Uses function to do repeated lookups

0. <strong>utf8</strong> 

   It provides examples of counting and comparing Asian characters encoded in UTF-8.
   
   * Provides an illustration of fmt.Print() vs. fmt.Println() with escapted double-quotes.
   * Provides an example of using range.

0. cd to <strong>env-vars</strong> (in Git branch env-vars)

   cd

## Structure of program files

https://medium.com/@benbjohnson/standard-package-layout-7cdbc8391fc1


## Data Types

boolean constants are lower case: true, false

Numbers are not permitted at the start of an identifier (variable).

Go detects unused imports as an error.

Go has an array type, but most interactions are with slices which are built
off arrays. I don't worry too much about the name and just use them
The specification for slices are "[]T" where T is the type.
So "[]string" is a set of strings, "[]int" is a set of integers, and so on.


Conditionals: 

    <pre>
    var n int = 4
    var i = 0
    for i = 1; i < n; i++ {
        println(i)
    }
    </pre>

int is actually an alias!
Like C, Go has signed and unsigned integers:

   * int holds a maximum value of 32,000.
   * int8, 
   * int16, 
   * int32, 
   * int64


<a href="utf8"></a>

### UTF-8 Data Types

Alias <strong>rune</strong> are single-character constants: 'a', す', 'シ', '1', …

When working with unicode you should be converting your strings to []rune. 
That's why the utf8 package is so sparse, most things are covered by []rune conversion and the unicode package.
The utf8 package is like a very thin abstraction layer for using strings as []rune.

All source code in Go is UTF-8, so you can use an emoji, Japanese Kanji, or other language in variable names:

   <pre>
    var π = 3.14159
    var radius = 6371.0 // radius of the Earth in km
    var circumference = 2 * π * radius
&nbsp;
    println("Circumference of the earth is", circumference, "km")
   </pre>

   Run result in scientific notation:

   <pre>
   Circumference of the earth is +4.003014e+004 km
   </pre>

See https://coderwall.com/p/k7zvyg/dealing-with-unicode-in-go


## Developer Tools

0. Display documentation for the Println function within fmt:

   <pre>godoc fmt Println</pre>

   Println formats using the default formats for its operands and writes to
   standard output. Spaces are always added between operands and a newline
   is appended. It returns the number of bytes written and any write error encountered.

## Testing/Error Handling

assert: extended core testing capabilities to write tests more easily

errors: improved error handling


## Logic

if … { … } else { … }, switch { … }

   Heavily nested if else if blocks are discouraged.

for (init statement); condition; (post statement) { … }

   As Go is a strongly typed language, for two variables to be equal, both their type and their value must be equal.

while condition { … } and 

do { … } while condition

do { … } until condition

// TODO: Control flow: break, fallthrough, continue, goto, return.


0. <strong>sync.go</strong> uses Concurrency features.

   One of Go's biggest strengths is that the concurrency features it provides are 
   much easier to understand and use properly than threads and locks.

   Go has "goroutines" that are lightweight concurrency model based on coroutines.
   Goroutines do not use convoluted callback coding styles.

   PROTIP: The design of the Go language makes it work on multiple CPU cores.
   I can't begin to state how important this is for scalability and speed.

   Go's language runtime makes sure that there are enough threads to keep cores active.


   ### Go's defer command.

   A defer statement defers the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns.

   The deferred call's arguments are evaluated immediately, but the function call is not executed until the surrounding function returns.

   Deferred function calls are pushed onto a stack. 
   When a function returns, its deferred calls are executed in last-in-first-out order.

    <pre>
  fmt.Println("counting")
  for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    defer fmt.Println(i)
  }
  fmt.Println("done")
    </pre>

   ### Webpage folder templates 

0. In <strong>webpage, main.go</strong> uses a templating capability with mustache markers:

   <pre>{{/* comments don't nest */}}
   </pre>

   * Display a line before running as a server which locks no command line input:

   <pre>
   fmt.Println("Use internet browser to view localhost:8080.")
   fmt.Println("Press control+C to stop server.")
   http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)

## Impose Artificial Load 

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rakyll/hey">
https://github.com/rakyll/hey</a>
consists of two utility Go programs used to impose load on servers by making HTTP and HTTP/2 requests.

The program is influenced from Tarek Ziade's tool at [tarekziade/boom](https://github.com/tarekziade/boom). 

It was written by Google for use in its <a target="_blank" href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/gcp-aws-scaling-and-balancing/index.html?index=..%2F..%2Findex#4">
Google's Scale and Load Balance Instances and Apps tutorial</a>.

To send 10 requests per second to the load balancer (substituting your load balancer's external IP):

   <tt><strong>hey -n 12000 -c 10 -q 1 http://<em>load-balancer-IP</em>
   </strong></tt>

Additional arguments enable HTTP headers to set authentication data, etc.

Monitoring is achieved by other means.
