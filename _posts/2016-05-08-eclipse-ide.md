This article contains note on my personal experience installing and using Eclipse IDE.

There are several versions and editions of Eclipse IDE.

   * Java
   * Web
   * <a href="#STS">STS</a>


<a name="HomebrewInstall"></a>

## Homebrew install #

If you want to use the standard version of Eclipse,
use [Homebrew](/macos-homebrew/) to 
<a target="_blank" href="http://macappstore.org/eclipse-java/">eclipse-java</a>:

0. First, update the Homebrew installation bits:

   <tt><strong>
   brew update
   </strong></tt>

   This usually takes a while.

0. Use cask used to install GUI programs:

   <tt><strong>
   brew cask install eclipse-java
   </strong></tt>

   The response (as of 8 July 2016):

   <pre>
Please migrate your Casks to the new location and delete /opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom,
or if you would like to keep your Caskroom at /opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom, add the
following to your HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS:
&nbsp;
  --caskroom=/opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom
&nbsp;
For more details on each of those options, see https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/issues/21913.
