This article contains note on my personal experience installing and using Eclipse IDE.

Eclipse was originally funded by IBM as open source.

The editions of Eclipse IDE:

   * The "Standard" edition for working with Java is free
   * The edition working with Web (HTML) is licensed (costs money)
   * <a href="#STS">STS</a> edition


<a name="HomebrewInstall"></a>

## Standard Edition Homebrew install #

The simplest way to install the <strong>standard</strong> edition of Eclipse
is to use [Homebrew](/macos-homebrew/) to 
<a target="_blank" href="http://macappstore.org/eclipse-java/">eclipse-java</a>:

0. First, update the Homebrew installation bits shared:

   <pre><strong>brew update
   </strong></pre>

   This can take a while.

0. Use cask to install GUI programs:

   <pre><strong>brew cask install eclipse-java
   </strong></pre>

   The response (as of 24 July 2017):

   <pre>
==> Satisfying dependencies
==> Downloading https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/
######################################################################## 100.0%
==> Verifying checksum for Cask eclipse-java
==> Installing Cask eclipse-java
==> Moving App 'Eclipse.app' to '/Applications/Eclipse Java.app'.
üç∫  eclipse-java was successfully installed!
   </pre>

   Remember the name of the app is "Eclipse Java".

   ### Invoke

0. On a Mac, in a Finder click Go > Applications or
   click the "rocket ship" icon if you have that at the bar at bottom of the screen.

0. Type the portion of "Eclipse Java" until the icon appears.

   ### Add STS

   In a Standard Eclipse, you can add STS in 

0. Help > Eclipse Marketplace and Find: Spring.
0. Click Install.
0. In Confirm Selected Features, check all (for AOP, AERI, Roo, etc.) explained later.

   ### Uninstall Homebrew

0. The nice thing about using Homebrew is uninstallation is easy:

   <pre><strong>brew cask uninstall eclipse-java
   </strong></pre>


<strong>Alternately:</strong>


<a name="STS"></a>

## STS install on Macs #

There is no Homebrew module for the Spring Tools Suite (STS) for Mac.

0. Use a modern internet browser to the STS download page at<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://spring.io/tools/sts/all">
   https://spring.io/tools/sts/all</a>
0. Click on "Based on Eclipse 4.7.0", then "tar.gz".

   spring-tool-suite-3.9.0.RELEASE-e4.7.0-macosx-cocoa-x86_64.tar is 412.5 MB.

0. In Finder, select the Download folder to receive the file, then click "Save".
0. While you're waiting, switch to exit the download web page.
0. Double click on the file to unzip it to a new folder.

   CAUTION: If you see a number to the right of the "sts-bundle" folder name,
   another installer was downloaded previously.

0. In Finder, navigate inside the "sts-bundle" folder.
0. Open a new Finder new window and click the Go menu for the
   <strong>/Applications</strong> folder.
0. If there is another STS app there, move it to Trash.

0. Long-Click on the <strong>STS</strong> app file, then drag and drop it 
   onto the Applications window.
0. Open STS by double-clicking the icon. It may take a minute to load the first time.
0. Press command+tab until your land on the green Spring app icon for the Eclipse Launcher.
0. Check "Use this as the default and do not ask again".
0. PROTIP: The default directory generated should be changed per your organization's standards.

   /Users/mac/Documents/workspace-sts-3.9.0.RELEASE

   PROTIP: This folder path is where you should do git clone. The one I use is<br />
   `/Users/mac/gits/spring`. Others define a "dev" folder<br />
   `/Users/mac/dev/workspace`


   This can be changed to something else later, though.

   The folder path is created when you click "Launch".

0. For the menu, click on the white space in the <strong>Dashboard</strong> with Package Explorer.

   See <a target="_blank" href="https://www.predix.io/resources/tutorials/journey.html#1607">

<a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/spring-tool-suite-sts-eclipse">
Included with STS</a> (Spring Tools Suite)
is the developer edition of Pivotal <strong>tc</strong> Server, 
the drop-in replacement for Apache Tomcat 
that‚Äôs optimized for Spring.

The Spring Insight console, tc Server Developer Edition, 
provides a graphical real-time view of application performance metrics that lets developers identify and diagnose problems from their desktops.
