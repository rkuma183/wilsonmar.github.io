This article contains note on my personal experience installing and using Eclipse IDE.

Eclipse was originally funded by IBM as open source.

Chose an edition of Eclipse IDE:

   a. The "Standard" edition for working with Java is free<br />
   b. <a href="#STS">STS</a> edition<br />
   c. The edition working with Web (HTML) is licensed (costs money)


<a name="HomebrewInstall"></a>

## a. Standard Edition Homebrew install #

The simplest way to install the <strong>standard</strong> edition of Eclipse
is to use [Homebrew](/macos-homebrew/) to 
<a target="_blank" href="http://macappstore.org/eclipse-java/">eclipse-java</a>:

0. First, update the Homebrew installation bits shared:

   <pre><strong>brew update
   </strong></pre>

   This can take a while.

0. Use cask to install GUI programs:

   <pre><strong>brew cask install eclipse-java
   </strong></pre>

   The response (as of 24 July 2017):

   <pre>
==> Satisfying dependencies
==> Downloading https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/
######################################################################## 100.0%
==> Verifying checksum for Cask eclipse-java
==> Installing Cask eclipse-java
==> Moving App 'Eclipse.app' to '/Applications/Eclipse Java.app'.
üç∫  eclipse-java was successfully installed!
   </pre>

   Remember the name of the app is "Eclipse Java".

   ### Invoke

0. On a Mac, in a Finder click Go > Applications or
   click the "rocket ship" icon if you have that at the bar at bottom of the screen.

0. Type the portion of "Eclipse Java" until the icon appears.

   ### Add STS

   Optionally, you can add STS to a Standard Eclipse install:

0. Help > Eclipse Marketplace and Find: Spring.
0. Click Install.
0. In Confirm Selected Features, check all (for AOP, AERI, Roo, etc.) explained later.

   ### Uninstall Homebrew

0. The nice thing about using Homebrew is uninstallation is easy:

   <pre><strong>brew cask uninstall eclipse-java
   </strong></pre>


<strong>Alternately:</strong>


<a name="STS"></a>

## b. STS install from Spring #

There is no Homebrew module for the Spring Tools Suite (STS) for Mac.

0. Use a modern internet browser to the STS download page at<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://spring.io/tools/sts/all">
   https://spring.io/tools/sts/all</a>

   Alternately, download the installer from:<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="
   https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">
   https://www.eclipse.org/downloads</a>

0. Click on the file just downloaded: "Based on Eclipse 4.7.0" under "Mac", then "dmg 397MB".
0. Click "Save File" in the pop-up.

   spring-tool-suite-3.9.2.RELEASE-e4.7.2-macosx-cocoa-x86_64.dmg

0. Click the downloads icon for your browser to expand it.
0. Drag the "Spring" icon STS and drop on the Applications folder.

0. Switch to Finder. Click the Go menu for the
   <strong>/Applications</strong> folder.

   CAUTION: If you see a number to the right of the "sts-bundle" folder name,
   another installer was downloaded previously.

0. If there is another STS app there, move it to Trash.
0. If you will be using it a lot, drag and drop the STS icon to Apple's bar.
0. Open STS by double-clicking the icon. It may take a minute to load the first time.
0. If you get an "Are you sure you want to open it?", click Yes.
0. Select a directory as workspace. PROTIP: Instead of something like "/Users/wilsonm/Documents/workspace-sts-3.9.2.RELEASE"
   use a folder under Git. 

   PROTIP: The default directory generated should be changed per your organization's standards.

   /Users/mac/Documents/workspace-sts-3.9.0.RELEASE

   PROTIP: This folder path is where you should do git clone. The one I use is<br />
   `/Users/mac/gits/spring`. Others define a "dev" folder<br />
   `/Users/mac/dev/workspace`

   This can be changed to something else later (in Files, Switch Workspace).

   The folder path is created when you click "Launch". STS will create folders that don't exist.

0. For the menu, right-click on the white space in the <strong>Dashboard</strong> with Package Explorer.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/spring-tool-suite-sts-eclipse">
   Included with STS</a> (Spring Tools Suite)
   is the developer edition of Pivotal <strong>tc</strong> Server, 
   the drop-in replacement for Apache Tomcat web server optimized for Spring.

   The Spring Insight console, tc Server Developer Edition, 
   provides a graphical real-time view of application performance metrics that lets developers identify and diagnose problems from their desktops.

0. Click Finish.

0. To compile and run your program, keep the "Main" app Java file tab active and 

   * use Run option available in the Eclipse IDE or
