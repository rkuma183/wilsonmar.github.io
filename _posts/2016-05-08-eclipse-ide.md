This article contains note on my personal experience installing and using Eclipse IDE.

It was originally funded by IBM as open source.

There are several versions and editions of Eclipse IDE.

   * Java is free
   * Web
   * <a href="#STS">STS</a>


<a name="HomebrewInstall"></a>

## Homebrew install #

If you want to use the standard version of Eclipse,
use [Homebrew](/macos-homebrew/) to 
<a target="_blank" href="http://macappstore.org/eclipse-java/">eclipse-java</a>:

0. First, update the Homebrew installation bits:

   <tt><strong>
   brew update
   </strong></tt>

   This usually takes a while.

0. Use cask used to install GUI programs:

   <tt><strong>
   brew cask install eclipse-java
   </strong></tt>

   The response (as of 8 July 2016):

   <pre>
Please migrate your Casks to the new location and delete /opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom,
or if you would like to keep your Caskroom at /opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom, add the
following to your HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS:
&nbsp;
  --caskroom=/opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom
&nbsp;
For more details on each of those options, see https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/issues/21913.
