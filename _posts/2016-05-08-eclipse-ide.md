This article contains note on my personal experience installing and using Eclipse IDE.

Eclipse was originally funded by IBM as open source.

The editions of Eclipse IDE:

   * The "Standard" edition for working with Java is free
   * The edition working with Web (HTML) is licensed (costs money)
   * <a href="#STS">STS</a> edition


<a name="HomebrewInstall"></a>

## Homebrew install #

The simplest way to install the <strong>standard</strong> edition of Eclipse
is to use [Homebrew](/macos-homebrew/) to 
<a target="_blank" href="http://macappstore.org/eclipse-java/">eclipse-java</a>:

0. First, update the Homebrew installation bits shared:

   <pre><strong>brew update
   </strong></pre>

   This usually takes a while.

0. Use cask to install GUI programs:

   <pre><strong>brew cask install eclipse-java
   </strong></pre>

   The response (as of 24 July 2017):

   <pre>
==> Satisfying dependencies
==> Downloading https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/
######################################################################## 100.0%
==> Verifying checksum for Cask eclipse-java
==> Installing Cask eclipse-java
==> Moving App 'Eclipse.app' to '/Applications/Eclipse Java.app'.
üç∫  eclipse-java was successfully installed!
   </pre>

   Remember the name of the app is "Eclipse Java".

0. The nice thing about using Homebrew is uninstallation is easy:

   <pre><strong>brew cask uninstall eclipse-java
   </strong></pre>

   ### Invoke

0. On a Mac, click the "rocket ship" icon at the bar at bottom of the screen or
   in a Finder click Go > Applications.

0. Type the portion of "Eclipse Java" until the icon appears.


<a name="STS"></a>

## STS install #

https://www.predix.io/resources/tutorials/journey.html#1607

0. Use an interest browser to the STS website.
0. Select a download site to begin download. Wait for the file to download.
0. Unzip
0. In Finder, navigate inside the folder, such as:

   ~/Documents/workspace-sts-3.8.0.RELEASE

   This contains the server.

0. Move and/or rename the folder according to your organization's standards.

0. In Finder navigate to /Applications.
0. Move (drag and drop) STS.app to /Applications.
0. Open STS by double-clicking the icon.
0. Click Open icon for first-time confirmation.
0. Specify your workspace.

## First Time Preferences #

When you invoke Eclipse for the first time, you see a "Welcome" screen.

0. At the lower-right of the screen, uncheck "Always show Welcome at start up".

0. Click "Review IDE configuration settings" to "Review the IDE's most fiercely contested preferences".

   * Show line numbers in editor: yes.
   * Check spelling
   * Execute jobs in background
   * Encode text files with UTF-8

   if you want to change it.
