This tutorial describes how to make use of Finder to manage files using a mouse.

Three ways to relaunch the Finder:

0. Hold the Option key and right-click the Finder icon in the Dock, then select Relaunch.

0. Press the command key with your right hand and option+esc key combo with your left hand
   for the Force Quit menu. Then select the Finder and click Relaunch.

0. Click the Apple button at the upper-left corner to select <strong>Log out</strong>. 
   Then log back in to your user account.

## Open Terminal from Finder Folder #

If you're a developer, it's hard to get away from using a command-line terminal. But if you're using a MacOS just for social media, you won't need a Terminal. That's why it's kinda buried:

0. Click the Finder icon on the bottom.
0. Click Applications on the left pane.
0. Click Utilities.
0. Click Terminal.

   This would place you at your user Home directory.

PROTIP: Since Yosemite, you can open a Terminal to a folder listed within Finder by pointing your mouse on it, then tapping with two fingers on the touchpad/mousepad.

Alternately:

<ol type="1">
<li> Click the Apple icon, System Preferences....</li>
<li> Press K and select Keyboard.</li>
<li> Click Shortcuts, Services.</li>
<li> Scroll to the <strong>Files and Folders</strong> section.</li>
<li> Check on <strong>New Terminal at Folder</strong>.</li>
<li> Close the dialog by clicking the red dot at the upper left corner.</li>
</ol>
