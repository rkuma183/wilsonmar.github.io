Here is a tutorial on how to make Git on a local machine
run a script automatically in response to git commands.


## Dimensions to Hooks
   
   Hooks can run run on two locations:
   * <a href="#ClientHooks">client-side hooks</a> (on your laptop) and 
   * <a href="#ServerHooks">server-side hooks</a> (on GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc.).

   Hooks are run at two different times:
   * Pre-commit and
   * Post-commit.

   This illustration (by Sarah Goff-Dupont of Atlassian) identifies the most common uses across the four situations:
   <img width="628" alt="githooksgrid" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/26756862/c95a944c-4879-11e7-8de2-a57e47df93f7.png">
   <a target="_blank" href="https://dzone.com/articles/3-git-hooks-for-continuous-integration/">
   

   <a name="ClientHooks"></a>

### Hooks On the client

The free Community Edition (CE) of IntelliJ IDEA from Jetbrains provides check-boxes to activate built-in Git hook functionality:

<img alt="git intellij before commit 302x418-87kb" width="302" height="418" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/20950204/8c6d379a-bbdb-11e6-9e31-58dc370be2de.png">

PROTIP: We don’t see how to get to Version Control in IntelliJ on videos because 
it’s often accessed via a hotkey - Apple command 9 on macs and Alt+9 on Windows.

See <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8KSaQKgR1Y">
this video</a> about VCS improvements in IntelliJ 2016.3.

Let's use a sample project that already has
<strong>.idea</strong> folder containing files that define configurations for IntelliJ.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.3/new-project-wizard.html">
IntelliJ has a project wizard to start from scratch on various languages</a>.

## Default Git Hooks

   PROTIP: Every Git repository is created with a hooks folder.

1. Navigate into any Git repository you want to automate.

   `cd .git/hooks`

   Git and GitHub looks into this folder for scripts to run when specific events occur.
   
   PROTIP: Git and GitHub have been written such that it recognizes specific file names for each internal event.

   PROTIP: Each Git repository is created with a set of sample automation files in the folder.
   But the file names end with ".sample" so that they won't run.

   Listed alphabetically:

   <pre>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--applypatch-msg.sample">applypatch-msg.sample</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--commit-msg.sample">commit-msg.sample</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--post-update.sample">post-update.sample</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--pre-applypatch.sample">pre-applypatch.sample</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--pre-commit.sample">pre-commit.sample</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--pre-push.sample">pre-push.sample</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--pre-rebase.sample">pre-rebase.sample</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--pre-receive.sample">pre-receive.sample</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--prepare-commit-msg.sample">prepare-commit-msg.sample</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--update.sample">update.sample</a>
   </pre>

   There are others that Git automatically runs.
   
   <pre>
   pre-checkout
   pre-applypatch
   post-applypatch
   post-merge
   post-receive
   pre-auto-gc
   post-rewrite runs after a commit is modified by a git commit --amend or git rebase.
   </pre>
   
2. PROTIP: Click each link above for the lastest version online at:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/templates">
   https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/templates</a>

   CAUTION: Nobody uses the default files as they are by just removing the ".sample" part of the file name
   because they probably don't do what you want.

3. Delete the sample files in your repo because it's best to get the latest version from GitHub.
   
   ### No file extension
   
   Git and GitHub were written to recognize command files that have <strong>no file extension</strong>,
   since in Linux the type of command is defined in the first line within each file
   (with a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)#Magic_number">"SheBang magic number"</a>)
   rather than in the file name's extension as in Windows.

  ### Multiple languages

   Git will run any script that can run on the command line (and properly installed):

   * Bash shell is the default
   * JavaScript (<a target="_blank" href="https://mochajs.org/">mocha</a>)
   * Ruby
   * Python
   * Groovy
   * <a href="#PowerShell">PowerShell</a> (see below)


## Demo on git-utilities

I have prepared a repository to demo use of local Git hooks to run.
The repo contains a "hooks" folder containing script files.
Files in the folder are copied into the `.git/hooks` folder where Git looks.

1. In an internet browser, go to this repository (which we will later call the "upstream"):

   <a target="_blank" href="
   https://github.com/wilsonmar/git-utilities">
   https://github.com/wilsonmar/git-utilities</a>

2. Sign in using your account. The rest of this document assumes "hotwilson" is your account name.
   So replace "hotwilson" with your own account whereever you see it.

3. Fork the repo under your own account.

4. Open a Terminal window.
5. Make and cd into a folder where you will the repository will be downloaded.

   Again, in this example, you would change "hotwilson" to your own account name.

   <pre><strong>
   cd ~ && mkdir gits && cd gits && mkdir hotwilson && cd hotwilson
   </strong></pre>

6. Confirm you are indeed where you want to create a new repository:
   
   <pre><strong>
   pwd
   </strong></pre>

7. Clone to download:
   
   <pre><strong>
   git clone https://github.com/hotwilson/git-utilities.git
   cd git-utilities
   </strong></pre>

8. Optionally, to enable updates from the original repo:
   
   <pre><strong>
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/wilsonmar/git-utilities.git
   git remote -v
   </strong></pre>

9. Copy these lines and paste in Terminal (at the root folder) to copy demo hook files from the hooks folder into the .gits/hooks folder:

   <pre><strong>
   cp hooks/* .git/hooks
   chmod +x .git/hooks/*
   </strong></pre>

   PROTIP: In Mac and Linux machines, scripts must be authorized to be run using the chmod command.

   PROTIP: It is too difficult and dangerous to edit and add/commit files inside the .git folder, 
   which Git itself uses to track changes. So copying files in is the better approach than error messages such as:

   <pre>fatal: This operation must be run in a work tree</pre>

   Alternatively, symbolic links or symlinks can be used to link custom hooks to the ones in the .git/hooks folder.

10. Copy these lines and paste in the Terminal to make a change, then add and commit it for the Git Hook to take action:
   
   <pre><strong>
   echo "random text" >>README.md
   git add .
   git commit -m"try git commit hooks"
   </strong></pre>

   Each of the demo hook files can contain variables. For example:

   <pre>
   #!/bin/sh
   COMMIT_MSG_FILE=$1  # ".git/COMMIT_EDITMSG"
   echo "prepare-commit-msg: $(cat $COMMIT_MSG_FILE)"
   exit 0
   </pre>

## CheatSheet

Daniel Convissor made <a target="_blank" href="https://www.analysisandsolutions.com/code/git-hooks-summary-cheat-sheet.htm">

## git commit hooks

   The flow of processing on the client is illustrated by this (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M75aENmuzmo&t=1m">from Johan Abildskov & Jan Krag of Praqma</a>)<br />
   <a title="git hooks diagram 1406x541.png" href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/26558608/27a5209a-4478-11e7-8780-4a9209bbef80.png" target="_blank">
   <img alt="git hooks diagram 650x251" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/26558599/1ced0780-4478-11e7-93da-95db47b5eaf9.png">(click for full screen image)</a>

   Upon `git commit`, client hooks are executed in this order:

1. The <strong>pre-commit</strong> hook runs after a git commit is executed, but before the commit message editor is displayed. Since an exit from this with anything other than zero aborts the commit, it is the place to check assets involved in the commit itself (rather than the commit message), to run <strong>linters and unit tests</strong> on the local laptop. This program has access to the commit date/time, author name and email.

   NOTE: pre-commit hooks do not support hooks with side effects (such as modifying files and adding them to the index with git add). 

   A non-zero exit aborts the commit, which can happen if a file being committed contains "#DONTPUSH" (or other keyword recognized by the hook program) developers put there as a <strong>reminder</strong> to hold off pushing to the team repository. 

2. The <strong>prepare-commit-msg</strong> hook is invoked after receiving a git commit, just prior to firing up the commit message editor. This hook can <strong>edit the commit message</strong> in a way that cannot be suppressed. 
   For example, ensuring a capital letter. 
   
   QUESTION: This has access to the commit SHA-1 (when operating on an existing commit)?

3. The <strong>commit-msg</strong> hook <strong>adjusts the commit message</strong> after it has been edited in order to ensure conformity to a standard or to reject based on any criteria. It can abort the commit if it exits with a non-zero value.

4. The <strong>post-commit</strong> hook is called after the actual commit is made so that it cannot disrupt the commit. It is mainly used for <strong>sending notifications</strong> (emails, SMS, Slack, Twitter, etc.).
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-git-hooks-to-automate-development-and-deployment-tasks">This NOTE</a> describes deploying to a Local Web Server with a Post-Commit Hook.

   * pre-rebase is run before Git executes `git rebase`.
   * applypatch-msg is run before Git executes `git patch`.
   
### Sample JavaScript Mocha linter

From https://scotch.io/tutorials/using-git-hooks-in-your-development-workflow#client-side-hooks

   <pre>
#!/bin/bash
&nbsp;
# Exits with non zero status if tests fail or linting errors exist
num_of_failures=`mocha -R json | grep failures -m 1 | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's/[,]/''/'`
&nbsp;
errors=`jscs -r inline ./test/test.js`
num_of_linting_errors=`jscs -r junit ./test/test.js | grep failures -m 1 | awk '{print $4}' | sed 's/failures=/''/' | sed s/">"/''/ | sed s/\"/''/ | sed s/\"/''/`
&nbsp;
if [ $num_of_failures != '0' ]; then
  echo "$num_of_failures tests have failed. You cannot commit until all tests pass.
        Commit exiting with a non-zero status."
  exit 1
fi
&nbsp;
if [ $num_of_linting_errors !=  '0' ]; then
  echo "Linting errors present. $errors"
  exit 1
fi
   </pre>


### Useful Hook examples
  
*  A list of websites offering Git hooks is at Matthew Hudson's <a target="_blank" href="http://githooks.com/">
   githooks.com</a>, along with projects others have done with hooks.

## One-liner to install and run Selenium

0. Open a Terminal shell window to where you would like to add a script.
   One example on a Mac is a folder under your home directory, such as:

   `/Users/mac/gits`

0. Copy this script to your Clipboard and paste it on the Terminal command line.

   <pre>
   `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wilsonmar/Basic-Selenium-Java/master/mac-bootstrap.sh)"`
   </pre>

   (Press Enter to run).

   The script downloadloads all pre-requisites before running the test.


   ### Step through the automation

0. Use Finder to look at the repo.

   The target being developed/tested is the Java source code under folder
   /src/test/java/localbrowsers.

   Each ".java" program is a unit test to simply retrieve a website in a browser.

   The "memory-leak.java" source file intentionally creates a memory leak when run.

   The `basic-selenium-java.iml` file.

0. Install internet browsers used by running the shell script:

   `chmod +x mac_install_browsers.sh && ./mac_install_browsers.sh`

   Installed are browser add-ins for testing (with cask being used for GUI apps).
   Links to websites have been added:

   * brew install geckodriver
   * brew cask install firefox

   * brew install chromedriver
   * brew cask install google-chrome
   * brew install <a target="_blank" href="http://phantomjs.org/">
   phantomjs</a> (a "headless" browser)
   
   * Safari doesn't need to be installed because it comes with Apple Macs.
   <br /><br />

   If you get this error, rerun:

   `curl: (56) SSLRead() return error -9806`

0. Use Finder to look at the <strong>pom.xml</strong> file
   specifying Java stuff to be downloaded:

   * org.seleniumhq.selenium
   * org.testng
   <br /><br />

   Maven plug-ins:

   * <strong>maven-surefire-plugin</strong>
    from http://maven.apache.org/components/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/
   to execute tests. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2ok6mKU0TI

   * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jacoco.org/">
   <strong>jacoco-maven-plugin</strong> (http://www.jacoco.org/)</a> for determines code coverage.
   (It was written for running in Eclipse, but IntelliJ uses it too.)

   * <strong>coveralls-maven-plugin</strong>
    from https://github.com/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin
   to track code coverage over time
   
0. Look at the configuration files:

   codecov.yml is read by javaco.io ???

   mac-only.xml 

   sonar-project.properties

   .travis.yml for using the Travis on-line service ???

0. Run the repo's installation script implementing the <strong>pom.xml</strong> file
   specifying Java stuff to be downloaded:

   <pre>mvn install</pre>

0. Run manually on a Mac:

   <pre>mvn test -Dsurefire.suiteXmlFiles=mac-only.xml
   </pre>

   This opens up several browser programs.
   In each, go to the same URL, checks if the correct title in HTML was received.
   Browser windows are closed after each test.

   The browsers are Firefox, Chrome, PhantomJS. Not Safari yet.

   travis server > browsers > clean test mac-only > codecov parallel with sonar > reports to codecov history

0. Under `Results` should be no Failures or Errors:

   <pre>Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0</pre>

   Git knows whether the test passed by looking at environment variable.
   If it is zero, Git continues.
   Any other number, Git stops.

0. Scroll back up to see the run times, like this:

   <pre>
   Total time: 19.101 s
   </pre>


   ### Verify hook execution

   No error message is issued if there is an error.

0. cd into your repo's .git/hooks folder and execute the file:

   <pre>
   ./git-commit
   </pre>

   PROTIP: The most common problem reported is not having the correct permissions set by

   <pre>
   chmod +x git-commit
   </pre>



## pre-rebase test

0. Use a text editor to create in the hooks folder a "pre-rebase" containing
   this text described in YouTube video
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RG26-Iozg70">
   Life’s better with Git hooks - Grumpy Gits</a>
   [17:58] Nov 16, 2015 by Deepank Vora.

   <pre>
#!/bin/sh
echo "Custom rebasing message."
exit 1
   </pre>

   (Unlike Windows, Linux defines file handling 
   in the first line inside the file).

   PROTIP: Non-zero finish aborts the commit.

0. Enable the new script:

   <pre><strong>
   chmod +x pre-rebase
   </strong></pre>

   This would avoid messages such as:

   <pre>
-bash: ./pre-rebase: No such file or directory
   </pre>

0. Run the new script to make sure it works:

   <pre><strong>
   ./pre-rebase
   </strong></pre>

0. Open another Terminal shell window to the working directory of the repo
   to run the `git rebase master` command.

   You should see the custom message.

   QUESTION: If instead you see:

   <pre>
Current branch master is up to date.
   </pre>


   ### View pre-commit.sample

0. Use a text editor Set to always open .sample files with a text editor.

   `#!/bin/sh` at the top of the file means that it's a Bash shell script.

   (Author Junio C Hamano is the primary developer of Git, now works at Google.)

## GitLab

You can connect to the GitLab API using your API key to perform actions inside GitLab when performing, for example, a commit. This you can do from the client side, but of course, you can also use the server-side hooks, such as post-receive to run programs and scripts after they have reached the remote. An example is at:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlab-public-wiki/wiki/Hooks">
   https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlab-public-wiki/wiki/Hooks</a>


## closes or fixes #

0. The following script is saved as `.git/hooks/commit-msg` (with no file extension):

   <pre>
#!/bin/sh
   PRIVATE_TOKEN="API_KEY"
   GITLAB_URL="https://your_gitlab_domain.com"
   URL=`git config --get remote.origin.url`
   PROJECT=`basename ${URL} .git | cut -d':' -f2`
   for issue_id in `grep -o -e "\(closes\|fixes\) #[0-9]\+" $1 | cut
   -d'#' -f2`; do
       curl -X PUT -d "closed=1" \
           ${GITLAB_URL}api/v3/projects/${PROJECT}/issues/${issue_
   id}/?private_token=${PRIVATE_TOKEN}
   done
   </pre>

1. Edit the program with your gitlab URL.

   If this script sees a commit message text containing "closes #" or "fixes #",
   the hook closes the issue identified by the number after the # symbol.

0. Make the file executable to enable this functionality. 

   <pre><strong>chmod +x *
   </strong></pre>
   

<a name="PowerShell"></a>

## PowerShell script


To have Git run a PowerShell script on pre-commit, 
<a target="_blank" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5629261/running-powershell-scripts-as-git-hooks">try</a>
to create a shell script 

   <pre>
#!/bin/sh
# pre-commit (no file extension)
c:/Windows/System32/WindowsPowerShell/v1.0/powershell.exe \
-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Command .\.git\hooks\pre-commit.ps1
   </pre>

To test, put this `pre-commit.ps1` script in the hooks folder.


<a name="ServerHooks"></a>

## Hooks on the server

The order of execution is:

   1. <strong>pre-receive</strong> run just before pushed files are updated. So it can abort the receive process by exiting with a non-zero status. Thus, it is used to enforce commit policies and reject the entire commit if it is deemed unsatisfactory. (code coverage)
   
   2. <strong>update</strong> filters each commit ref made to the remote repository independently. It can be used to reject or accept each ref being pushed.
   
   3. <strong>post-receive</strong> is triggered after an update has been done on the remote repository. So it cannot abort the update process. But it can trigger notifications on a successful remote repository update. (send email, run load tests, so that a log of notifications is stored on a remote server.
   <br /><br />

Before we get into manual installation steps,
you need to know that there are automated options available.
