Here is a tutorial on how to make Git on a local machine
run a script automatically in response to git commands.

## How Git Hooks work

Every Git repository is created with a hooks folder.
Git looks into the `.git/hooks` folder for scripts when events occur.

PROTIP: In your GitHub repository, create a "hooks" folder containing script files 
that a new repo setup script copies into the `.git/hooks` folder.   

0. Navigate into any Git repository you want to automate.

   `cd .git/hooks`

   Each Git repository folder is created with a set of sample automation files.

   <pre>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--applypatch-msg.sample">applypatch-msg.sample</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--commit-msg.sample">commit-msg.sample</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--post-update.sample">post-update.sample</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--pre-applypatch.sample">pre-applypatch.sample</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--pre-commit.sample">pre-commit.sample</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--pre-push.sample">pre-push.sample</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--pre-rebase.sample">pre-rebase.sample</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--pre-receive.sample">pre-receive.sample</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--prepare-commit-msg.sample">prepare-commit-msg.sample</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--update.sample">update.sample</a>
   </pre>

   PROTIP: You may delete these sample files 
   because I've added links to each file listed above to 
   the source of the files at:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/templates">
   https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/templates</a>


   These file names end with ".sample" so that they won't run.
   This is because Git automatically runs files renamed with no file extension,
   such as "pre-commit" (renamed from "pre-commit.sample"). 
   But most people edit the file when they rename to customize the action they want.

   PROTIP: A longer list is at Matthew Hudson's <a target="_blank" href="http://githooks.com/">
   githooks.com</a>, along with projects others have done with hooks.
   The canonical documentation is at
   <a target="_blank" href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks">
   https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks</a>


   ### Hooks by Event
   
   There are two types of hooks: 
   client (on your laptor or server) and 
   server (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).

   <img width="628" alt="githooksgrid" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/26756862/c95a944c-4879-11e7-8de2-a57e47df93f7.png">
   <a target="_blank" href="https://dzone.com/articles/3-git-hooks-for-continuous-integration/">
   This illustration</a> 
   (by Sarah Goff-Dupont of Atlassian)
   identifies the most common uses.


   #### On the client

   On the client, upon `git commit`, the hooks are executed in this order:

   0. pre-commit (to run unit tests, look for console messages, etc.)
   0. prepare-commit-msg (add extra alerts)
   0. commit-msg (send email to collaborators)
   0. post-commit 
   <br /><br />

   * pre-rebase is run before Git executes `git rebase`.
   * applypatch-msg is run before Git executes `git patch`.
   
   #### On the server

   0. pre-receive (code coverage)
   0. update
   0. post-receive (send email, run load tests)
   <br /><br />

The flow of processing is illustrated by this (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M75aENmuzmo&t=1m">from Johan Abildskov & Jan Krag of Praqma</a>)<br />

Before we get into manual instllation steps,
you need to know that there are automated options available.


## IntelliJ IDE Automation

IntelliJ IDEA from Jetbrains, the free Community Edition, provides check-boxes to activate
Git hooks.

<img alt="git intellij before commit 302x418-87kb" width="302" height="418" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/20950204/8c6d379a-bbdb-11e6-9e31-58dc370be2de.png">

PROTIP: We don’t see how to get to Version Control in IntelliJ on videos because 
it’s often accessed via a hotkey - apple 9 on macs and Alt+9 on Windows.

See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8KSaQKgR1Y
for VCS improvements in IntelliJ 2016.3.

Let's use a sample project that already has
<strong>.idea</strong> folder containing files that define configurations for IntelliJ.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.3/new-project-wizard.html">
IntelliJ has a project wizard to start from scratch on various languages</a>.

But Andrew Krug's Java example also has integration with testing utilities.


## One-liner to install and run

0. Open a Terminal shell window to where you would like to add a script.
   One example on a Mac is a folder under your home directory, such as:

   `/Users/mac/gits`

0. Copy this script to your Clipboard and paste it on the Terminal command line.

   <pre>
   `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wilsonmar/Basic-Selenium-Java/master/mac-bootstrap.sh)"`
   </pre>

   (Press Enter to run).

   The script downloadloads all pre-requisites before running the test.


   ### Step through the automation

0. Use Finder to look at the repo.

   The target being developed/tested is the Java source code under folder
   /src/test/java/localbrowsers.

   Each ".java" program is a unit test to simply retrieve a website in a browser.

   The "memory-leak.java" source file intentionally creates a memory leak when run.

   The `basic-selenium-java.iml` file.

0. Install internet browsers used by running the shell script:

   `chmod +x mac_install_browsers.sh && ./mac_install_browsers.sh`

   Installed are browser add-ins for testing (with cask being used for GUI apps).
   Links to websites have been added:

   * brew install geckodriver
   * brew cask install firefox
   * brew install chromedriver
   * brew cask install google-chrome
   * brew install <a target="_blank" href="http://phantomjs.org/">
   phantomjs</a> (a "headless" browser)
   * Safari doesn't need to be installed because it comes with Apple Macs.
   <br /><br />

   If you get this error, rerun:

   `curl: (56) SSLRead() return error -9806`

0. Use Finder to look at the <strong>pom.xml</strong> file
   specifying Java stuff to be downloaded:

   * org.seleniumhq.selenium
   * org.testng
   <br /><br />

   Maven plug-ins:

   * <strong>maven-surefire-plugin</strong>
    from http://maven.apache.org/components/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/
   to execute tests. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2ok6mKU0TI

   * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jacoco.org/">
   <strong>jacoco-maven-plugin</strong> (http://www.jacoco.org/)</a> for determines code coverage.
   (It was written for running in Eclipse, but IntelliJ uses it too.)

   * <strong>coveralls-maven-plugin</strong>
    from https://github.com/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin
   to track code coverage over time
   
0. Look at the configuration files:

   codecov.yml is read by javaco.io ???

   mac-only.xml 

   sonar-project.properties

   .travis.yml for using the Travis on-line service ???

0. Run the repo's installation script implementing the <strong>pom.xml</strong> file
   specifying Java stuff to be downloaded:

   <pre>mvn install</pre>

0. Run manually on a Mac:

   <pre>mvn test -Dsurefire.suiteXmlFiles=mac-only.xml
   </pre>

   This opens up several browser programs.
   In each, go to the same URL, checks if the correct title in HTML was received.
   Browser windows are closed after each test.

   The browsers are Firefox, Chrome, PhantomJS. Not Safari yet.

   travis server > browsers > clean test mac-only > codecov parallel with sonar > reports to codecov history

0. Under `Results` should be no Failures or Errors:

   <pre>Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0</pre>

   Git knows whether the test passed by looking at environment variable.
   If it is zero, Git continues.
   Any other number, Git stops.

0. Scroll back up to see the run times, like this:

   <pre>
   Total time: 19.101 s
   </pre>


   ### Verify hook execution

   No error message is issued if there is an error.

0. cd into your repo's .git/hooks folder and execute the files:

   <pre>
   ./git-commit
   </pre>

   The most common problem reported is not having the correct permissions set by

   <pre>
   chmod +x git-commit
   </pre>



## pre-rebase test

0. Use a text editor to create in the hooks folder a "pre-rebase" containing
   this text described in YouTube video
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RG26-Iozg70">

   [17:58] Nov 16, 2015 by Deepank Vora.

   <pre>
#!/bin/sh
echo "Custom rebasing message."
exit 1
   </pre>

   (Unlike Windows, Linux defines file handling 
   in the first line inside the file).

   PROTIP: Non-zero finish aborts the commit.

0. Enable the new script:

   <pre><strong>
   chmod +x pre-rebase
   </strong></pre>

   This would avoid messages such as:

   <pre>
-bash: ./pre-rebase: No such file or directory
   </pre>

0. Run the new script to make sure it works:

   <pre><strong>
   ./pre-rebase
   </strong></pre>

0. Open another Terminal shell window to the working directory of the repo
   to run the `git rebase master` command.

   You should see the custom message.

   QUESTION: If instead you see:

   <pre>
Current branch master is up to date.
   </pre>


   ### View pre-commit.sample

0. Use a text editor   Set to always open .sample files with a text editor.

   `#!/bin/sh` at the top of the file means that it's a Bash shell script.

   (Author Junio C Hamano is the primary developer of Git, now works at Google.)


<hr />

## Scripts by language

   Git will run any script that can run on the command line:

   * Bash shell is the default

   * Ruby
   * Python
   * Groovy
   * <a href="#PowerShell">PowerShell</a>


<a name="PowerShell"></a>

## PowerShell script


To have Git run a PowerShell script on pre-commit, 
<a target="_blank" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5629261/running-powershell-scripts-as-git-hooks">try</a>
to create a shell script 

   <pre>
#!/bin/sh
# pre-commit (no file extension)
c:/Windows/System32/WindowsPowerShell/v1.0/powershell.exe \
-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Command .\.git\hooks\pre-commit.ps1
   </pre>

To test, put this `pre-commit.ps1` script in the folder:
