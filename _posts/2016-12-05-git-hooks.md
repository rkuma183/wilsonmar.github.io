Here is a tutorial on how to make Git on a local machine automatically
run a "hook" script in response to git commands.


## Dimensions to Hooks
   
   Hooks scripts run on two locations:
   * <a href="#ClientHooks">client-side hooks</a> (on your laptop) and 
   * <a href="#ServerHooks">server-side hooks</a> (on GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc.).


   <a name="hookevents"></a>

   Git and GitHub have been written to look for a hook program before and after each of these commands:

   * git clone
   * git checkout
   * <a href="#GitCommitHooks">git commit</a>
   * <a href="#GitRebaseHooks">git rebase</a>
   * <a href="#GitPatchHooks">git patch</a> (applypatch-msg)
   * <a href="#GitPushHooks">git push</a>
   * git merge
   * git am
   * git gc --auto
   <br /><br />

   Just so we can use nerdy language, hooks before each event begin with "pre-" and 
   hooks after each even begin with "post-". This illustration (by Sarah Goff-Dupont of Atlassian) identifies common uses across four situations:
   <img width="628" alt="githooksgrid" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/26756862/c95a944c-4879-11e7-8de2-a57e47df93f7.png">
   <a target="_blank" href="https://dzone.com/articles/3-git-hooks-for-continuous-integration/">
   

### Ensure adherance to standards

   PROTIP: Some organizations impose a set of hook files on repositories in order to impose some standards, such as:
   
   * Reject very short commit messages, such as 10 characters or less.
   * Move media files (.mp4, .mp3, .jpg, .png) from repositories that are only "supposed" to contain text to a repository hold media files that humans can't read. The job of <a href="#git-lfs">git-lfs (Large File System)</a> is to move and replace binary files with a (texual) link to binary repositories.
   * etc.



   <a name="ClientHooks"></a>

### Hooks On the client

The free Community Edition (CE) of IntelliJ IDEA from Jetbrains provides check-boxes to activate built-in Git hook functionality:

<img alt="git intellij before commit 302x418-87kb" width="302" height="418" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/20950204/8c6d379a-bbdb-11e6-9e31-58dc370be2de.png">

PROTIP: We don’t see how to get to Version Control in IntelliJ on videos because 
it’s often accessed via a hotkey - Apple command 9 on macs and Alt+9 on Windows.

See <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8KSaQKgR1Y">
this video</a> about VCS improvements in IntelliJ 2016.3.

Let's use a sample project that already has
<strong>.idea</strong> folder containing files that define configurations for IntelliJ.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.3/new-project-wizard.html">
IntelliJ has a project wizard to start from scratch on various languages</a>.


## Default Git Hook files

   PROTIP: Every Git repository is created with a hooks folder containing sample hook files that are named so they don't execute.

1. Navigate into any Git repository you want to automate.

   `cd .git/hooks`

   Git and GitHub looks into this specific folder name for scripts to run when <a href="#hookevents">specific events</a> occur.
   
   PROTIP: Git and GitHub have been written such that it recognizes specific file names for each internal event.

   PROTIP: Each Git repository is created with a set of sample automation files in the folder.
   But the file names end with ".sample" so that they won't run.

   Listed alphabetically:

   <pre>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--applypatch-msg.sample">applypatch-msg.sample</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--commit-msg.sample">commit-msg.sample</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--post-update.sample">post-update.sample</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--pre-applypatch.sample">pre-applypatch.sample</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--pre-commit.sample">pre-commit.sample</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--pre-push.sample">pre-push.sample</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--pre-rebase.sample">pre-rebase.sample</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--pre-receive.sample">pre-receive.sample</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--prepare-commit-msg.sample">prepare-commit-msg.sample</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--update.sample">update.sample</a>
   </pre>

   There are others that Git automatically runs.
   
   <pre>
   pre-checkout
   pre-applypatch
   post-applypatch
   post-merge
   post-receive
   pre-auto-gc
   post-rewrite runs after a commit is modified by a git commit --amend or git rebase.
   </pre>
   
2. PROTIP: Click each link above for the lastest version online at:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/templates">
   https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/templates</a>

   CAUTION: Nobody uses the default files as they are by just removing the ".sample" part of the file name
   because they probably don't do what you want.

3. Delete the sample files in your repo because it's best to get the latest version from GitHub.
   

   ### No file extension
   
   Due to their Linux origins,
   Git and GitHub were written to recognize command files that have <strong>no file extension</strong>,
   since in Linux the type of command is defined in the first line within each file
   (with a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)#Magic_number">"SheBang magic number"</a>)
   rather than in the file name's extension as in Windows.

   ### Multiple languages

   Git will run any script that can run on the command line (and properly installed):

   * <a href="#BashHook">Bash shell</a> is the default
   * JavaScript (<a target="_blank" href="https://mochajs.org/">mocha</a>)
   * Ruby
   * <a href="#PythonHook">Python</a>
   * Groovy
   * <a href="#PowerShell">PowerShell</a> (see below)
   <br /><br />

   All commands in a particular hook file must be of the same language.
  
   <a name="git-lfs"></a>
   <a name="BashHook"></a>

   #### Bash hook script

   During installation of git-lfs (GitHub's Large File System), 
   commands like these are placed in hook files:

   <pre>
#!/bin/sh
command -v git-lfs >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo >&2 "\nThis repository is configured for Git LFS but 'git-lfs' was not found on your path. If you no longer wish to use Git LFS, remove this hook by deleting .git/hooks/post-commit.\n"; exit 2; }
git lfs post-commit "$@"
</pre>

   The above commands first checks if git-lfs is installed, then performs the git lfs command,
   with "$@" forwarding the attributes passed into the hook file.

   The hook files used by git-lfs are:

   * pre-push
   * post-checkout
   * post-commit
   * post-merge
   <br /><br />


   <a name="PythonHook"></a>

   #### Python hook script

   <a target="_blank" href="http://omerkatz.com/blog/2013/5/23/git-hooks-part-2-implementing-git-hooks-using-python">
   NOTE</a>: The minimal Python hook script:

   <pre>
#!/usr/bin/env python
# post-checkout hook
import argparse
def parse_args():
  pass
def main(args=None):
  pass
if __name__ == "__main__":
  args = parse_args()
main(args)
   </pre>

   TODO: Print out values of arguments supplied when calling the hook.


   <a name="PowerShell"></a>

   #### PowerShell script

   <a target="_blank" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5629261/running-powershell-scripts-as-git-hooks">
   NOTE</a>: To have Git run a PowerShell script, a shell script invokes an additional PowerShell (.ps1) file added in the hooks folder:

   <pre>
#!/bin/sh
# pre-commit (no file extension)
c:/Windows/System32/WindowsPowerShell/v1.0/powershell.exe \
-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Command .\.git\hooks\pre-commit.ps1
   </pre>


## Demo simple hooks

I have prepared a repository to demo use of local Git hooks to run.
The repo contains a "hooks" folder containing script files.
Files in the folder are copied into the `.git/hooks` folder where Git looks.

1. In an internet browser, go to this repository (which we will later call the "upstream"):

   <a target="_blank" href="
   https://github.com/wilsonmar/git-utilities">
   https://github.com/wilsonmar/git-utilities</a>

2. Sign in using your account. The rest of this document assumes "hotwilson" is your account name.
   So replace "hotwilson" with your own account whereever you see it.

3. Fork the repo under your own account.

4. Open a Terminal window.
5. Make and cd into a folder where you will the repository will be downloaded.

   Again, in this example, you would change "hotwilson" to your own account name.

   <pre><strong>
   cd ~ && mkdir gits && cd gits && mkdir hotwilson && cd hotwilson
   </strong></pre>

6. Confirm you are indeed where you want to create a new repository:
   
   <pre><strong>
   pwd
   </strong></pre>

7. Clone to download:
   
   <pre><strong>
   git clone https://github.com/hotwilson/git-utilities.git
   cd git-utilities
   </strong></pre>

8. Optionally, to enable updates from the original repo:
   
   <pre><strong>
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/wilsonmar/git-utilities.git
   git remote -v
   </strong></pre>


   ### Global templates

   <a target="_blank" href="http://omerkatz.com/blog/2013/5/23/git-hooks-part-2-implementing-git-hooks-using-python">
   NOTE</a> Git looks for hooks in a global template folder applicable to all repositories
   when either a GIT_TEMPLATE_DIR variable is set in .bash_profile or .gitconfig contains a setting defined by command:

   <pre><strong>
   git config --global init.templatedir /path/to/your/templates/
   </strong></pre>

   Alternatively, symbolic links or symlinks can be used to link custom hooks to the ones in the .git/hooks folder.

9. Copy these lines and paste in Terminal (at the root folder) to copy demo hook files from the hooks folder into the .gits/hooks folder:

   <pre><strong>
   cp hooks/* .git/hooks
   chmod +x .git/hooks/*
   </strong></pre>

   PROTIP: In Mac and Linux machines, scripts must be authorized to be run using the chmod command.

   PROTIP: It is too difficult and dangerous to edit and add/commit files inside the .git folder, 
   which Git itself uses to track changes. So copying files in is the better approach than error messages such as:

   <pre>fatal: This operation must be run in a work tree</pre>

10. Copy these lines and paste in the Terminal to make a change, then add and commit it for the Git Hook to take action:
   
    <pre><strong>
    echo "random text" >>README.md
    git add .
    git commit -m"try git commit hooks"
    </strong></pre>

    ### Skip hook invocation

    BTW one can suppress hooks from firing with the `--no-verify` command attribute:

    <pre>git commit --no-verify</pre>

    ### Variables

    Each of the demo hook files can contain variables. For example:

    <pre>
    #!/bin/sh
    COMMIT_MSG_FILE=$1  # ".git/COMMIT_EDITMSG"
    echo "prepare-commit-msg: $(cat $COMMIT_MSG_FILE)"
    exit 0
    </pre>

The table lists for each hook what command triggers it, when it runs, what parameters are passed into it, and
what happens when the hook exits abnormally (with a 1).


<a name="GitCommitHooks"></a>

## git commit hooks

First of all, there is already some editing to git commit. Git does not allow empty commit messages. If a commit message does not include a message, your favorite editor is opened for you to enter one. If you still haven’t typed anything in your editor, Git aborts the commit.

   The flow of processing on the client is illustrated by this (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M75aENmuzmo&t=1m">from Johan Abildskov & Jan Krag of Praqma</a>)<br />
   <a title="git hooks diagram 1406x541.png" href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/26558608/27a5209a-4478-11e7-8780-4a9209bbef80.png" target="_blank">
   <img alt="git hooks diagram 650x251" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/26558599/1ced0780-4478-11e7-93da-95db47b5eaf9.png">(click for full screen image)</a>

   Upon `git commit`, client hooks are executed in this order:

1. The <strong>pre-commit</strong> hook runs after a git commit is executed, but before the commit message editor is displayed. Since an exit from this with anything other than zero aborts the commit, it is the place to check assets involved in the commit itself (rather than the commit message), to run <strong>linters and unit tests</strong> on the local laptop. This program has access to the commit date/time, author name and email.

   NOTE: pre-commit hooks do not support hooks with side effects (such as modifying files and adding them to the index with git add). 

   A non-zero exit aborts the commit, which can happen if a file being committed contains "#DONTPUSH" (or other keyword recognized by the hook program) developers put in their code as a <strong>reminder</strong> to hold off pushing to the team repository. 
   
   <a target="_blank" href="http://codeinthehole.com/tips/tips-for-using-a-git-pre-commit-hook/">
   The following</a> pre-commit code keeps debugging code (such as "console.log" debugging statements) from reaching the shared code base:

   <pre>
FILES_PATTERN='\.(js|coffee)(\..+)?$'
FORBIDDEN='console.log'
git diff --cached --name-only | \
    grep -E $FILES_PATTERN | \
    GREP_COLOR='4;5;37;41' xargs grep --color --with-filename -n $FORBIDDEN && echo 'COMMIT REJECTED Found "$FORBIDDEN" references. Please remove them before commiting' && exit 1
   </pre>

2. The <strong>prepare-commit-msg</strong> hook is invoked after receiving a git commit, just prior to firing up the commit message editor. This hook can <strong>edit the commit message</strong> in a way that cannot be suppressed. 
   For example, ensuring a capital letter. 
   
   QUESTION: This has access to the commit SHA-1 (when operating on an existing commit)?

3. The <strong>commit-msg</strong> hook <strong>adjusts the commit message</strong> after it has been edited in order to ensure conformity to a standard or to reject based on any criteria. It can abort the commit if it exits with a non-zero value.

4. The <strong>post-commit</strong> hook is called after the actual commit is made so that it cannot disrupt the commit. It is mainly used for <strong>sending notifications</strong> (emails, SMS, Slack, Twitter, etc.).
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-git-hooks-to-automate-development-and-deployment-tasks">This NOTE</a> describes deploying to a Local Web Server with a Post-Commit Hook.

   
<a name="GitPushHooks"></a>

## git push hooks

The order of execution is:

   1. <strong>pre-receive</strong> run just before pushed files are updated. So it can abort the receive process by exiting with a non-zero status. Thus, it is used to enforce commit policies and reject the entire commit if it is deemed unsatisfactory. (code coverage)
   
   2. <strong>update</strong> filters each commit ref made to the remote repository independently. It can be used to reject or accept each ref being pushed.
   
   3. <strong>post-receive</strong> is triggered after an update has been done on the remote repository. So it cannot abort the update process. But it can trigger notifications on a successful remote repository update. (send email, run load tests, so that a log of notifications is stored on a remote server.

### Sample JavaScript Mocha linter

From https://scotch.io/tutorials/using-git-hooks-in-your-development-workflow#client-side-hooks

   <pre>
#!/bin/bash
&nbsp;
# Exits with non zero status if tests fail or linting errors exist
num_of_failures=`mocha -R json | grep failures -m 1 | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's/[,]/''/'`
&nbsp;
errors=`jscs -r inline ./test/test.js`
num_of_linting_errors=`jscs -r junit ./test/test.js | grep failures -m 1 | awk '{print $4}' | sed 's/failures=/''/' | sed s/">"/''/ | sed s/\"/''/ | sed s/\"/''/`
&nbsp;
if [ $num_of_failures != '0' ]; then
  echo "$num_of_failures tests have failed. You cannot commit until all tests pass.
        Commit exiting with a non-zero status."
  exit 1
fi
&nbsp;
if [ $num_of_linting_errors !=  '0' ]; then
  echo "Linting errors present. $errors"
  exit 1
fi
   </pre>

<a name="GitRebaseHooks"></a>

## pre-rebase hooks

0. Use a text editor to create in the hooks folder a "pre-rebase" containing
   this text described in YouTube video
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RG26-Iozg70">
   Life’s better with Git hooks - Grumpy Gits</a>
   [17:58] Nov 16, 2015 by Deepank Vora.

   <pre>
#!/bin/sh
echo "Custom rebasing message."
exit 1
   </pre>

   (Unlike Windows, Linux defines file handling 
   in the first line inside the file).

   PROTIP: Non-zero finish aborts the commit.

0. Enable the new script:

   <pre><strong>
   chmod +x pre-rebase
   </strong></pre>

   This would avoid messages such as:

   <pre>
-bash: ./pre-rebase: No such file or directory
   </pre>

0. Run the new script to make sure it works:

   <pre><strong>
   ./pre-rebase
   </strong></pre>

0. Open another Terminal shell window to the working directory of the repo
   to run the `git rebase master` command.

   You should see the custom message.

   QUESTION: If instead you see:

   <pre>
Current branch master is up to date.
   </pre>


   ### View pre-commit.sample

0. Use a text editor Set to always open .sample files with a text editor.

   `#!/bin/sh` at the top of the file means that it's a Bash shell script.

   (Author Junio C Hamano is the primary developer of Git, now works at Google.)



<a name="#GitPatchHooks"></a> 

applypatch-msg


## GitLab

You can connect to the GitLab API using your API key to perform actions inside GitLab when performing, for example, a commit. This you can do from the client side, but of course, you can also use the server-side hooks, such as post-receive to run programs and scripts after they have reached the remote. An example is at:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlab-public-wiki/wiki/Hooks">
   https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlab-public-wiki/wiki/Hooks</a>


## closes or fixes #

0. The following script is saved as `.git/hooks/commit-msg` (with no file extension):

   <pre>
#!/bin/sh
   PRIVATE_TOKEN="API_KEY"
   GITLAB_URL="https://your_gitlab_domain.com"
   URL=`git config --get remote.origin.url`
   PROJECT=`basename ${URL} .git | cut -d':' -f2`
   for issue_id in `grep -o -e "\(closes\|fixes\) #[0-9]\+" $1 | cut
   -d'#' -f2`; do
       curl -X PUT -d "closed=1" \
           ${GITLAB_URL}api/v3/projects/${PROJECT}/issues/${issue_
   id}/?private_token=${PRIVATE_TOKEN}
   done
   </pre>

1. Edit the program with your gitlab URL.

   If this script sees a commit message text containing "closes #" or "fixes #",
   the hook closes the issue identified by the number after the # symbol.

0. Make the file executable to enable this functionality. 

   <pre><strong>chmod +x *
   </strong></pre>
