## Install

The application that NeoLoad uses as a sample,
<a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/jpetstore/">
   JPetStore</a>  is not installed and needs to be. Refer to the page 
<a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/jpetstore/">
   Here</a>, 

## Help

1. Clicking on the blue question mark icon at the top of the app
   takes you NeoLoad's internal web server at port 50000:

   <a target="_blank" href="http://127.0.0.1:50000/en/WebHelp/#787.htm">
   http://127.0.0.1:50000/en/WebHelp/#2983.htm</a>

   Also available over the internet at:

## Workflows

"User Paths" in NeoLoad is equivalent to "scripts" in other apps.
This is apropo because NeoLoad aims to provide check boxes
where other apps require additional coding.

   The trouble with a UI is that one must remember where the
   UI element is located and what happens when one checks each box.

Neoload's various UI forms is obtained by a hierarchy of buttons.
Three larger menu buttons in the middle of the heading 
brings up a different lower-level menu button.
Each of the 3 larger buttons is for a phase of the workflow.

   1. Design: User Paths, <a href="#Populations">Populations</a>, Monitors
   2. Runtime: Scenarios, Graphs, Erros, Alerts, Users
   3. Results: Summary, Values, Graphs, Erros, Alerts, Logs, Details


## Pre-recording 

### Browser Configuration

0. Get in Properties > General Settings > Browsers.

   Select the default browser.

0. Quit that browser. In fact, all browsers, and all other apps.

   Like many other similar tools, NeoLoad records by attaching itself to 
   a browser's process and capturing network transmissions in and out
   of it. So stray transmissions for other programs may be picked up,
   and require manual effort to remove (a hassle).

   ADVANTAGE: NeoLoad records in Safari browser.

0. Get in Properties > General Settings > HTTP Recorder.<br />
   NeoLoad provides a list of domains that it will ignore,
   a time-saving feature not available in most of its competitor's apps.

0. Add other URLs to the <strong>exclusion list</strong>.

   Each specification is a RegEx format.
   Thus, a question mark after https so that both http and https are recognized. 
   A <strong>.*</strong> is added at the end for any folder or 
   file name added to the host name.

   PROTIP: One line is used for each resource.

   * https://clients2.google.com/
   * https://translate.googleapis.com/
   * https://www.googleapis.com/
   * https://clients4.google.com/
   * https://clients1.google.com
   * http://cache.pack.google.com/
   * https://ssl.gstatic.com/
   * https://www.gstatic.com/
   * https://safebrowsing.google.com/
   * https://safebrowsing-cache.google.com/

### User workflow

PROTIP: It is common industry best practice to have a written plan
of what your users will be doing. This document will also make it easier
for others understand what the script is supposed to do.

See the post about <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/jpetstore/">
   JPetStore</a> for a description of steps and how they are used to focus performance testing.

### Proxy or Tunnel recording conditions

0. PROTIP: Find out if your server under test supports HTTP/2 (h2), Websockets, or Adobe RTMP (Real Time Messaging Protocol for Flex AMP), so you can check or uncheck the appropriate box in Advanced.

   If you don't know whether your application makes use of HTTP/2, put its public URL in this website tool:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://tools.keycdn.com/http2-test">
   https://tools.keycdn.com/http2-test</a>

0. Identify <strong>what percentage of visitors are returners?</strong>

   When starting from a clear cache on the client, the browser must
   load all resources.

   Since returning users have their cache filled, less downloading occurs
   than a completely new visitor. The difference can be very significant.

 0. Uncheck "Clear cache" if you are recording in the middle of a workflow sequence.

   QUESTION: How to establish cookies and cache as starting points
   in NeoLoad?


## Project

0. File New project.

   If you type a dash, a space, or other character it doesn't like,
   "The project name is invalid" appears.

   PROTIP: Use underline characters to separate words.

0. Click Finish.

0. If the Quick Start dialog appears, uncheck "Display next time",
   then "Start recording".


   ### Create New Recording

0. 


### Recording

NeoLoad works much like JMeter's UI by requiring right-click action on the 
list at the left of the screen.

## Post Recording

   ### URL Variable

0. Click the Variables icon.

   Define a variable for the domain, which will change when the script is used
   on different environments. For example:

   <pre><strong>myURL</strong></pre>

   ### URL Parametization

   Replace URLs captured with the variable between curly braces:

   <pre><strong>{myURL}</strong></pre>

0. Click the Varibles icon.


   ### Flag requests

   Right-click on User Paths to select <strong>Flag Requests</strong>,
   or press command-G.

   ### Check User Path



### Screen shots


### URL P


<a name="Populations"></a>

## Populations

"Populations" in NeoLoad specify WAN emulation which imposes delays experienced by various mobile network types and speeds.
