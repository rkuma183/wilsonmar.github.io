{% include _toc.html %}

Here is a short reminders to myself on use of NeoLoad.

This is a pre-requisite to my
[Selenium NeoLoad](/selenium_neoload/) page.


## Vs. Competitors

NeoLoad licenses cost less than LoadRunner. But there are also technical advantages.

NeoLoad comes with a proxy so you don't need to get one to get around corporate firewalls.
s
NeoLoad also comes with some monitoring capabilities.

NeoLoad has extra helpers that can be activated by a checkbox so you don't have to program as much.

However, NeoLoad does not provide a scheduling calendar like Performance Center.


## Download and Install

NeoLoad's download process can be confusing because the sign-up page is displayed
after sign-up.

1. If you don't have a license, go directly to the sign-up at:
   <a target="_blank" href="http://go.neotys.com/NeoLoad-Free-Edition-Download.html">

   For the scenic tour, first go to the home page<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.neotys.com/">
   https://www.neotys.com</a> 
   then click 
   <a target="_blank" href="http://go.neotys.com/NeoLoad-Free-Edition-Download.html">
   DOWNLOAD</a> for the page to get a license.

## Sample app

Any web page can be used.

The application that NeoLoad uses as a sample,
<a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/jpetstore/">
   JPetStore</a>  is not installed and needs to be. Refer to the page 
<a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/jpetstore/">
   Here</a>, 


## Start NeoLoad GUI

1. On a Mac, in Finder, press shift+command+A to open the Applications window.
2. Click the Name column to sort.
3. Press N to drill into the <strong>NeoLoad 6.0</strong> folder.
4. Drill into the <strong>bin</strong> folder.
5. Click <strong>NeoLoadGUI</strong> (green icon) to open it.
6. PROTIP: Drag the app file and drop on the programs list at the bottom of the screen.


## Help

Clicking on the blue question mark icon at the top of the app
   takes you NeoLoad's internal web server at port 50000:

   <a target="_blank" href="http://127.0.0.1:50000/en/WebHelp/#787.htm">
   http://127.0.0.1:50000/en/WebHelp/#2983.htm</a>

   Also available over the internet at:

   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.neotys.com/documents/doc/neoload/latest/en/html/#787.htm">
   http://www.neotys.com/documents/doc/neoload/latest/en/html/#787.htm</a>


## New Project

1. Click on File > New Project.
2. Type in a Project Name. Notice the default Directory is 

   <strong>`/Users/mac/neoload_projects`</strong>

   PROTIP: If you type a dash, a space, or other character it doesn't like,
   "The project name is invalid" appears.

   PROTIP: Use underline characters to separate words.

0. If the Quick Start dialog appears, uncheck "Display next time".

0. Click Finish.



## User Paths

![neoload-menu-6-1222x404-48k](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/28947978-cd762726-7880-11e7-970e-76354f4efc90.png)

"User Paths" in NeoLoad is equivalent to "scripts" in other apps.
This is apropo because NeoLoad aims to provide check boxes
where other apps require additional coding.

   The trouble with a UI is that one must remember where the
   UI element is located and what happens when one checks each box.

## Forms

Neoload's various UI forms is obtained by a hierarchy of buttons.
Three larger menu buttons in the middle of the heading 
brings up a different lower-level menu button.
Each of the 3 larger buttons is for a phase of the workflow.

   1. Design: User Paths, <a href="#Populations">Populations</a>, Monitors
   2. Runtime: Scenarios, Graphs, Erros, Alerts, Users
   3. Results: Summary, Values, Graphs, Erros, Alerts, Logs, Details


## Before recording 

### Browser Configuration

0. Get in Properties > General Settings > Browsers.

   Select the default browser.

0. Quit that browser. In fact, all browsers, and all other apps.

   Like many other similar tools, NeoLoad records by attaching itself to 
   a browser's process and capturing network transmissions in and out
   of it. So stray transmissions for other programs may be picked up,
   and require manual effort to remove (a hassle).

   ADVANTAGE: NeoLoad records in Safari browser.

0. Get in Properties > General Settings > HTTP Recorder.<br />
   NeoLoad provides a list of domains that it will ignore,
   a time-saving feature not available in most of its competitor's apps.

0. Add other URLs to the <strong>exclusion list</strong>.

   Each specification is a RegEx format.
   Thus, a question mark after https so that both http and https are recognized. 
   A <strong>.*</strong> is added at the end for any folder or 
   file name added to the host name.

   PROTIP: One line is used for each resource.

   * https://clients2.google.com/
   * https://translate.googleapis.com/
   * https://www.googleapis.com/
   * https://clients4.google.com/
   * https://clients1.google.com
   * http://cache.pack.google.com/
   * https://ssl.gstatic.com/
   * https://www.gstatic.com/
   * https://safebrowsing.google.com/
   * https://safebrowsing-cache.google.com/

### User workflow

PROTIP: It is common industry best practice to have a written plan
of what your users will be doing. This document will also make it easier
for others understand what the script is supposed to do.

See the post about <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/jpetstore/">
   JPetStore</a> for a description of steps and how they are used to focus performance testing.


### Proxy or Tunnel recording conditions

0. PROTIP: Find out if your server under test supports HTTP/2 (h2), Websockets, or Adobe RTMP (Real Time Messaging Protocol for Flex AMP), so you can check or uncheck the appropriate box in Advanced.

   If you don't know whether your application makes use of HTTP/2, put its public URL in this website tool:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://tools.keycdn.com/http2-test">
   https://tools.keycdn.com/http2-test</a>

0. Identify <strong>what percentage of visitors are returners?</strong>

   When starting from a clear cache on the client, the browser must
   load all resources.

   Since returning users have their cache filled, less downloading occurs
   than a completely new visitor. The difference can be very significant.

 0. Uncheck "Clear cache" if you are recording in the middle of a workflow sequence.

   QUESTION: How to establish cookies and cache as starting points
   in NeoLoad?


### Recording

NeoLoad works much like JMeter's UI by requiring right-click action on the 
list at the left of the screen.

   PROTIP: Liberally use abbreviations in names because there is not many characters visible.


## Post Recording

In the tree, there is a line for each resource requested.

Internally, the "script" is stored as an minified XML file within the config.zip file.


   ### URL Variable

0. Click the Variables icon.

   Define a variable for the domain, which will change when the script is used
   on different environments. For example:

   <pre><strong>myURL</strong></pre>

   ### URL Parametization

   Replace URLs captured with the variable between curly braces:

   <pre><strong>{myURL}</strong></pre>

0. Click the Variables icon.


   ### Flag requests to correlate

   Right-click on User Paths to select <strong>Flag Requests</strong>,
   or press command-G.


   ### Correlation Framework

   Make NeoLoad remember custom correlations so it's done automatically next time you record again.


## Check User Path

0. Click Check User

PROTIP: With Registration functionality, use "First time". Others should use a returning user.
To do otherwise would have the script download instead of re-using what's already in the browser cache.


## Logical actions

In Design, Virtual Users, the list of "Actions" on the lower-left panel is called the Logical Actions.



<a name="Populations"></a>

## Populations

"Populations" in NeoLoad specify WAN emulation which imposes delays experienced by various mobile network types and speeds.
