This article talks about the Robot Framework (RF) open-sourced at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/robotframework/">https://github.com/robotframework</a>
and described at <a target="_blank" href="http://robotframework.org">http://robotframework.org</a>

RF repeats a sequence of keystrokes and mouse clicks that you specify.

It is used to test software by applying (Acceptance Test Driven Development) approaches that looks for screens and fields before the app is developed.

It is also used as the base for "Robotic Process Automation" to help people do work.

There are many products and frameworks which do that.
Selenium works on web browsers.
FitNesse, Cucumber, 
HP QTP ('Unified Functional Testing' or 'UFT').

## Installation

The Robot Framework (RF) is written in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/">
Python</a> language, so it installs with this command:

   <pre><strong>pip install robotframework-ride</strong></pre>

   https://github.com/robotframework/QuickStartGuide/blob/master/QuickStart.rst

   This can be done on any OS that runs the Python interpreter: Windows, OS X, Linux.

   NOTE: Through a <em>Remote Library Interface</em>, RF can run (but slower) on 
<a target="_blank" href="http://ironpython.net/">IronPython</a> or
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> 
when automating on a Java application or implementing a custom RF test library in Java. 

Consequently, RF can be used with non-Python libraries such as the Java JDBC Database Library by running RF on Jython. The Jython interpreter not only compiles the RF Python code into Java bytecode for execution within a JVM, but also allows for the importing of Java classes (such as those of the Database Library) as (if they were) Python modules. See http://blog.xebia.com/the-robot-framework-remote-library-interface-using-the-remote-database-library-to-connect-to-ibm-db2/

Additionally, install the Robot IDE (RIDE):

   <pre><strong>pip install robotframework-ride</strong></pre>

Also, install the documentation utility:

   <pre><strong>pip install docutils</strong></pre>


## Disadvantages

RF is written to be a "keyword-driven", using the human-readable "Gherkin" syntax.

So one does need to memorize some keywords in order to be efficient at it.

Instead of coding programming code, it's faster to write 
keyword-driven syntax driven by text data files.

The Robot IDE (RIDE) requires a 32-bit Python version on MacOS and does not yet support Python 3.


## Architecture

The Robot Framework (RF)'s 
components are typical of most other test automation frameworks:

![python-robot-400x492-37552](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/38482765-d8faf808-3b8d-11e8-9ef6-489f5b13a5db.jpg)

Green boxes signifies Robot framework utility components whereas grey refers to app-specific components or artefacts, such as test code and product code, that are to be created by the development organization. The numbers indicate the order in which a typical test execution run would flow.

## Robot Framework Install

The core framework is operating system and application independent
because it's implemented using Python for running on Jython (JVM) and IronPython (.NET).

See https://github.com/robotframework/QuickStartGuide/blob/master/QuickStart.rst

0. Install the Robot Framework core:

   <pre>
   pip install robotframework
   </pre>

   The response:

   <pre>

0. To test databases and for example REST APIs, also install:

   <pre>
   pip install robotframework-databaselibrary
   pip install requests
   pip install botframework-requests
   </pre>

0. PROTIP: I don't recommend installing docutils because you can look it up online.

0. To install the demo Robot login script, create a folder to hold the demo repo:

   <pre>
   cd ~/gits/wilsonmar/pattern-recognition
   git clone https://github.com/robotframework/QuickStartGuide.git --depth=1
   cd QuickStartGuide
   </pre>

0. Position your present working directory to thePROTIP: I don't recommend installing docutils because you can look it up online.

0. Run the demo:

   <pre>
   robot QuickStart.rst
   </pre>

   NOTE: The file name extension (ending) .rst is also used by Ansible scripts.

   You will see this if the .rst file is not in the present folder:

   <pre>
[ ERROR ] Parsing 'QuickStart.rst' failed: Data source does not exist.
   </pre>

   The expected response is:

## Scripting

### Robot QuickStart Login Demo script

Many of the functions are common to other similar programs,
such as Selenium, HP QTP, etc.

But there are plugins for IntelliJ/PyCharm & Eclipse,
Atom, Sublime, TextMate, Vim, etc.
