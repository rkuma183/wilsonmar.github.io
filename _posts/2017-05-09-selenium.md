This article contains notes on installing, coding, and running Selenium.

1. <a name="#Obtain">Obtain jars and drivers</a>
2. <a name="#CodeJava">Code a basic starter</a> (Java in Selenium driving Chrome).
3. Add Firefox browser for cross-browser testing.

4. Add CSV 
5. Add Excel 

6. Add OpenQA
7. Add Tesseract

<a name="Obtain"></a>

## Obtain jars and drivers #

There are three basic ways to assemble what Selenium needs:

a. <a href="#CopyEstablished">Copy a working Selenium project</a>
   that already has the files needed. This is the quickest and simplest way.
b. Copy set of jars from a respository.
c. Code in pom.xml and run Maven.
d. <a name="ManualDownload">Manual download from websites</a>,
   which you'll need to do when a new version comes along. 

PROTIP: Download all the latest install files at one sitting to test compatibility of the set.
Assemble them together in a single folder for copying into each Selenium project folder
so each can stand alone when distributed.
