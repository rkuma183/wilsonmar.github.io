Hygieia (pronouced hi-GEE-ya, the name of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hygieia">
daughter of the Greek god of medicine and personification of hygiene and prevention of illness</a>.

The name is adopted for an open-source software project created at CapitalOne (the credit card company) 
which displays in a single <strong>dashboard</strong> the various statistics of a software delivery pipeline.

QUESTION: Does the dashboard cover 
these 16 gates in the pipeline (10 Commandments in octal):

## Program-level Pipeline Dashboard

![hygieia-pgm-shift-left-600x219](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/24074674/af146176-0be3-11e7-9eac-358a0a657ba7.png)
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.dynatrace.com/blog/scaling-continuous-delivery-shift-left-performance-to-improve-lead-time-pipeline-flow/">*</a>

Hygieia limits itself to just these environments:

   commit > build > DEV > QA > INT > PERF > PROD

PROTIP: Symptoms of health should also include:

   * <strong>Cycle time</strong> from idea to production

   * Man-Months of backlog in innovations and defect fix effort

   * Man-Months of "Technical Debt"

   * Percent of work <strong>unplanned</strong> ("error budget")

   * Percent of development (coding) innovation vs. repetitive work


## Trends over time 

Displays of <strong>trends</strong> over time are important to keep numbers in perspective,
both to keep from over reacting to momentary anomalies and 
from under-reacting to underlying patterns that need to be fixed.

PROTIP: So it's better to have a set of <strong>rotating dashboards</strong> 
(showing trends) than having just a number on a dashboard <strong>without context</strong> 
to whether that number is "good" or "bad".

PROTIP: Have a <strong>projection</strong> of what was expected at each point in time,
especially in the future.

Having an arbitrary <strong>target number can be counter-productive</strong> unless 
individual employees have a coherent
approach that balances the many conflicting needs.

For example, an insistance on "100% all the time" can lead staff to prioritize caution 
over <strong>innovation</strong>.

QUESTION: Should trend information be considered during a
Production Readiness Review (PRR)?

### Financial

<strong>Executives and business managers</strong>
typically focus on <strong>financials</strong> :

   * Total cost per transaction ratio
   * Total cost as percent of revenue
   * Total revenue per employee

## Bottom Line For Executives

Upper management need to manager a longer time horizon.
So they need to see <strong>trends</strong> over time, especially those 
that reflect <strong>customer experience</strong>
(not just internal processes):

   * Availability of the system 
   * Productivity of end-users using the system being developed, such as<br />
   purchases, invoices, or other business transactions processed during a <strong>peak hour</strong>.

   * Customer Net Promoter Score

   * Employee satisfaction
   * Employee turnover rate


## Architecture

Hygieia was written in Java to store data in a MongoDB database.

The Hygieia API server exposes REST APIs written in Spring Boot and mysema.querydsl.

The Hygieia core server provides the UI to data collected.


## Install server

0. Fork <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/">
https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia</a>
   to your own account.

0. Create a container folder to hold several related repositories.

   git clone https://github.com/ <em>My GitHub Acct</em> /Hygieia

   At the time of writing, this took up 131.1 MB of disk space.

   git clone https://github.com/ <em>My GitHub Acct</em> /Hygieia --depth=1

   At the time of writing, this took up 114.2 MB of disk space.

0. Download and build via maven using pom.xml file:

   <pre><strong>mvn clean install package</strong></pre>

   PROTIP: If you enjoy reading the deluge to the console, expand the Terminal width to avoid wrapping.

   The response:

   <pre>
[INFO] Total time: 08:34 min
[INFO] Finished at: 2017-03-18T21:11:46-04:00
[INFO] Final Memory: 108M/1581M
   </pre>

   At the time of writing, after install the folder takes <strong>1.23 GB of disk space</strong>.

0. Install MongoDB for the API data store
0. Run collectors with properties to connect to CI tools
0. Seteup Dashboard widgets & Visualize

   QUESTION: Can only have one dashboard?


PROTIP: Have computer programs monitor servers and take automatic actions.
