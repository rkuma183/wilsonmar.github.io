Here are various coding tips I've seen while going through [Python programming classes](/python-tutorials/) after [installing Python](/python-install/) and [Juypter](/juypter/).

Also see [Python REST API programming](/python-api-flask/).
[Python Robot testing](/python-robot/).
[Running Python on Raspberry Pi IoT devices](/iot-raspberry-install/).

## Command generator

docopt at https://github.com/docopt/docopt
and described at http://docopt.org/
creates custom CLI commands by
parsing a command help text into cli code that implements it.

Brilliant.


## Click 

<a target="_blank" href="https://dbader.org/blog/python-commandline-tools-with-click">
Dan Bader recommends</a> the use of the 

http://click.pocoo.org/6/why/
click custom package (from Armin Ronacher) instead of the
argparse package that comes with Python 3.2+ (and the optparse package that comes with Python 2).

Click provides decorators such as the "@click.command()" below:

   <pre>
\# cli.py
import click

@click.command()
def main():
    print("I'm a beautiful CLI âœ¨")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
   </pre>



## List comprehension

<pre>
squares = [x * x for x in range(10)]
</pre>


[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]


## Advanced

Dan Bader (aka Benedict Cumberbatch of Dr Strange and Sherlock Holmes) 
has emails and courses on Python:
