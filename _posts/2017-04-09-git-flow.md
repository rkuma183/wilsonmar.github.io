<hr />

{% include _toc.html %}

This page attempts to get those new to Git productive 
for professional usage, in the minimum time.

Two videos are presented, each followed by text about what was discussed in the video,
so you can understand the sequence of commands using Git with GiHub
for more "monolithic" systems that need more coordination
than what the GitHub workflow provides.

<!--

The first video explains use of <strong>native Git commands</strong> to 
obtain data from a repository you have permissions to update
and an "upstream" repository you do not have permission to update. 

This provides you the basis for understanding the value described in
the second video.

The second video shows how additional 
"helper" software called "Git Flow" 
can work with different types of branches.
-->

## About this presentation

This is for someone with a <a target="_blank" href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup">
Git command-line client installed</a>.

We encourage you to actually type out (rather than just read) 
the commands shown in the narrative below. 

In the text are also additional alternatives and comments not shown in the video.

PROTIP: Use two different browsers (Chrome and Firefox) simultaneously.



## The Git-client approach

<a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/26503691/bb789498-420f-11e7-8776-0758dc07241d.png">

<a name="HandsOn"></a>

Let's get hands-on typing each of the commands in the sequence presented in the video.

PROTIP: Click <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/git-whoops/">"Whoops"</a> links for instructions on un-doing the commands immediately
before the link. There is a "Return" link there to get back here and continue.



<a name="GitHubAccount"></a>

### GitHub

These steps are covered in my class handout:

0. Open a Gmail account if you haven't already.
0. Create an account on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.github.com/">GitHub.com</a>
   with a name that is available throughout various 
   social media.
0. Create a GitHub repository, such as a github.io website.
   The steps for this is covered in my course workbook.


<a name="Fork"></a>

## Fork

0. Here we have some stranger's repository in GitHub which we have no rights to edit. 

   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wilsonmar/git-utilities">
   https://github.com/wilsonmar/git-utilities</a>

0. (Thank you for clicking the Star.)

0. But if you <strong>fork</strong> it into your own GitHub account, you would then have rights to change it.

   * For example, if your account is "hotwilson", your copy of the repo would be:<br />
   <pre>https://github.com/hotwilson/git-utilities</pre>
   <br /><br />

   [ <a href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/git-whoops/#Fork">Whoops</a> ]


   <a name="GitClient"></a>
   
   ### Git client

   To work with repositories on your local machine, install a Git client. 

   * The various clients and how to install them are covered in my class handout.

   * This tutorial is called "Git-client based workflow" because it makes use of a Git client on your local machine.
   <br /><br />


   <a name="GitConfig"></a>
   
   ### Git config

0. Its installation includes adding in your user home folder a dot git folder containing a config file.
   That file stores git global commands such as username and userid settings for attribution. 

   <pre><strong>
git config --global user.name "Wilson Mar"
git config --global user.id "wilsonmar@gmail.com"
   </strong></pre>

   [ <a href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/git-whoops#GitConfig">Whoops</a> ]


   <a name="Terminal"></a>

## Terminal (vs GUI)

   Git commands are typed into a Terminal shell window on a Mac, a Git Bash command window on Windows, or a Run command window on Windows. Instructions for this are covered in my class handout.

   Most IDEs incorporate commonly used Git client functionality into their software. 

   In <strong>Eclipse</strong>, right-click on the project in the left Solution pane, then select <strong>Team</strong> for the Git menu:<br />
   ![git eclipse menu 518x648](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/25332307/ebf39f84-28b3-11e7-9d3b-5132a549cf13.png)

   * Eclipse "Switch To" = git checkout

   * Return to this picture after going through this course to see if you recognize what each GUI item does.

   In <strong>IntelliJ</strong>, right-click on the project in the left Solution pane, then 

   <a name="Clone"></a>

   ### Account folder

0. PROTIP: Create a folder to hold all your various repositories. 

   <pre><strong>cd ~
   mkdir gits
   cd gits
   </strong></pre>

   This would hold utilities applicable to all Git work.

0. PROTIP: Create an <strong>account folder</strong> to hold all your own repositories. 
   Cloning a repo does not include:

   <pre><strong>mkdir hotwilson
   cd hotwilson
   </strong></pre>

   CAUTION: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Azure/iot-edge/blob/master/doc/devbox_setup.md">
   Some repos</a> have a **20 character** limit on the prefix before the repo name.
   The character count includes slashes:

   <pre>/gits/hotwilson/----+----1----+----2</pre>

   ### Clone in account folder

0. Be in that folder when you clone a repository from GitHub. 

   * To obtain the URL from a browser at your repository, by clicking the green
   "Clone or Download": 

   ![git-flow hotwilson url-453x198-33kb.png](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/26530009/ddda1d22-439a-11e7-9120-5559fdff0454.png)

   * Alternately, substitute your own account (instead of "hotwilson") as your type:

   <pre><strong>git clone https://github.com/hotwilson/git-utilities --depth=1
   </strong></pre>

   * Add parameter ```--depth=1``` to only clone the latest version, to save disk space locally by
   not having previous version history on your machine.

   * Add parameter ```--recursive``` to pull in sub-modules (repositories stored within the repository).

   Git clone creates that repo's folder and within it a folder named dot git to hold objects that track changes to the repository.

   During cloning, Git automatically extracts files from objects out to the repository's folder, 
   as if you typed a `git checkout master` being the default branch. 

   [ <a href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/git-whoops#Clone">Whoops</a> ]


0. Remember to cd into the repository folder:

   <pre><strong>cd git-utilities
   </strong></pre>

   PROTIP: Forgetting to cd into a newly cloned folder is a common mistake.


   <a name="BranchList"></a>

   ### Branch list

0. A <strong>git branch</strong> command shows us the branches defined in the repository
   in a read-only operation:

   <pre><strong>git branch -avv</strong></pre>

   The ```-avv``` parameter provides more detail. Dash a specifies remote tracking branches to appear as well.

   <a href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/git-shortcuts/#gb">Alternately, shortcut</a>:

   <pre>gb</pre>

   An example of the response:

   <pre>
* master                6110cb1 [origin/master] Update ...
  remotes/origin/master 6110cb1 Update ...
   </pre>

   * The asterisk (*) marks the current branch

   * The default remote is origin with default branch master.

   * then close the Terminal and open up a new Terminal shell window.

   * Alternatively, identify just the current remote and branch using this command:

   <pre>git symbolic-ref --short HEAD﻿</pre>

   * A Git alternative to the Bash "pwd" (present working directory) command is:

   <pre>git rev-parse --show-toplevel</pre>
   <br /><br />

   PROTIP: Git defaults to the master branch. But many organizations protect that name for production use, and instead create a “development” or “dev” branch for developers to work with.

   <a name="Checkout"></a>

   ### git checkout

   The git checkout command controls what Git extracts 
   out from the repository database to the repository's folder. 

   * If you add a file after the git checkout command, Git will replace the file in the working folder with the version in 
   the committed repository.
   <br /><br />

   [ <a href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/git-whoops#Checkout">Whoops</a> ]


   <a name="NewBranch"></a>

   ### New branch with commit

   There are two ways to create a new branch.

   The standard way is: 

   <pre><strong>git branch <em>feat1</em>
   </strong></pre>

   <em>"feat1"</em> would be different for you. 

   Those who want to add additional information (metadata)
   about a branch use this command:

   <pre><strong>git branch --edit-description  <em>feat1</em>
   </strong></pre>

   This will result in an editor window for you to enter metadata about the branch.

   PROTIP: In real life, the example here -- "feat1" (feature1) 
   would instead begin with an issue number or some reference to the need for the branch.

   Alternately, those who don't need to add metadata may 
   prefer specifying a new branch name after
   a dash b (-g) with as part of a git checkout
   such as "feat1" (feature1), to associate new changes:

   <pre><strong>git checkout -b feat1
   </strong></pre>

   * PROTIP: Atlassian defines its branches<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4SoB3TFkjA&t=18m26s">*</a> 
   with a type (feature, bugfix, hotfix, etc.), a <strong>slash</strong>, 
   an issue number, then a short description.
   <br /><br />

   ![git atlassian branch naming 650x222](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/25307644/7de0e70a-2772-11e7-8b3c-f4a57f091f51.png)

   * The advantage of creating a branch is that <strong>parallel development</strong>
   can occur without risking the master branch.

   * Unlike Subversion, all files are available for change with a Git branch.

   [ <a href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/git-whoops#NewBranch">Whoops</a> ]


   <a name="NewBranchMeta"></a>

   ### New branch metadata


   <pre><strong>git --edit-description
   </strong></pre>


   <a name="Editing"></a>

   ### Editing

   Now we can edit the file named README.md. The md designates markdown format. 
   Such a file GitHub creates with this specific name to describe each repository.

   We can use vim or another text editor (such as nano, atom, etc.) to change contents inside files. 

   <pre><strong>vim README.md
   </strong></pre>

   * If you use vim, press the I key to begin insertion and press Esc to end insertion mode.
   When out of insertion mode, type : to enter command mode, 
   then <strong>wq</strong> to write and quit the program or
   then <strong>q!</strong> to quit without changes.

   We can use vim or another text editor (such as nano, atom, etc.) to change contents inside files. 

0. Make a change, then save the file.


   <a name="Status"></a>

   ### Status

   To detail the status of changes to the repo:

   <pre><strong>git status</strong> 

   Alternately, this command is used so often that Mac users create a [shortcut](/git-shortcuts/) in ~/.bash_profile:

   <pre>gs</pre>



   <a name="Add"></a>

   ### Add to Staging

0. You can change several files, but only the files you add to <strong>Git's staging area</strong> 
   will be pushed to GitHub. 

   <tt><strong>git add . -A</strong></tt>

   The dot selects all files changed, recursively inside sub-folders as well.

   The dash capital A parameter specifies that deleted files be processed. But many prefer to specifically add individual files to go into each particular commit, which works on all files added to staging. Instead of the dot, several files can be specified on the same command.

   Alternately, to add all the files modified (not new files created and untracked):

   <pre>git add -u</pre>

   [ <a href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/git-whoops#Add">Whoops</a> ]


   <a name="Commit"></a>

   ### Commit

0. The commit supplies a message describing changes, which applies to all files added. 

   <pre><strong>git commit -m"Update for show"</strong></pre>

   * A space is not needed between the m and the left quote of the message.

   * If you don't specify the dash m, Git will display a file containing comments as a prompt.

   Any line beginning with the # comment character will be ignored and not be part of the message.

   * If a GitHub account user name prefixed by an at sign (such as "@wilsonmar") is specified in the message, GitHub automatically sends an email.
   <br /><br />

   [ <a href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/git-whoops#Commit">Whoops</a> ]<br />
   

   <a name="Reflog"></a>

   ### Reflog

0. lists actions that have occurred on the local machine.

   <pre><strong>git reflog -5</strong></pre>

   Example output:

   <pre>
   9349be6 HEAD@{1}: commit: double quote removed for confusion
   9eb57bc HEAD@{2}: commit: mention gs shortcut 
   </pre>

   * Entries are pruned (removed) automatically after 90 days (by default).


   <a name="Rebasing"></a>

   ### Rebase to squash locally

   Before pushing to GitHub, some prefer to squash some commits so that only one commit message appears for several commits made locally. 

   * Rebasing cleans up intermediate commits that is unwanted noise to the rest of the team.
   The extra commits complicates the history, and makes back-out of code more difficult.

   * Yes, this changes history, which is why we do it. But it's only on your local versions.

   Study <a target="_blank" href="http://wilsonmar.github.io/git-rebase">http://wilsonmar.github.io/git-rebase</a>
   for step-by-step instructions. Then return here.


   <a name="Push"></a>

   ### Push

   The git push command sends to a remote what has been committed for a specific branch. 
   If you didn't paste your public key into GitHub, you would get an error now.

   <pre><strong>git push
   </strong></pre>

   [ <a href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/git-whoops#Push">Whoops</a> ]

   Alternately, Bash users who have setup an alias can use this which includes a git add and commit:

   <a href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/git-shortcuts#gas">gas "JIRA #1234"</a>
   
   This alias adds all changes and commits them all with a static "update" in message:

   <a href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/git-shortcuts#gbs">gbs</a> 

   The two aliases above include a `git push` for maximum convenience.


   <a name="Tags"></a>

   ### Push tags

0. When a commit is known good as the one to release, 
   most organizations tag that specific commit with <a target="_blank" href="http://semver.org/">
   semantic versioning</a> text.

   <pre>git tag v1.3.4</pre>

0. Tags require an additional git push command to be pushed to GitHub.

   <pre><strong>git push --tags</strong></pre>

   [ <a href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/git-whoops#Tags">Whoops</a> ]


   <a name="DeleteBranch"></a>

   ### Delete branch

0. Because branches are just markers within Git, once a feature branch is in GitHub, 
   that branch can be deleted from the local repo 

   <pre><strong>git branch -d feat1</strong></pre>

0. and from GitHub (by specifying that colon in front of the branch name). 

   <pre><strong>git push origin :feat1</strong></pre>

   NOTE: The colon is the secret special sauce. There is no "delete" command with this.


   <a name="PullRequest"></a>

   ### Pull Request

   Unless you have been designated a committer in the upstream repository, you can't push changes to it. But you can request their committers to pull changes from your forked repo. When a committer of that repo merges (or in other words, accepts) your PR, you'll get an email from GitHub.


   <a name="Upstream"></a>

   ### Upstream Remote

   Next, let's look at what happens if, over time, changes occur in the upstream repo. 

   The git remote –verification command tells us that the origin remote was created, as usual, with the repo. 

0. To enable dowload by Git, we add the upstream remote. 

   <pre>
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/wilsonmar/git-utilities
   </pre>

   * The URL is the one owned by someone else.
   <br /><br />

   [ <a href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/git-whoops#Upstream">Whoops</a> ]


   To obtain changes locally, many would rather NOT issue a git pull upstream command, which blindly fetches and automatically merges changes. Differences in the same line within the same file, Git is forced into automatic conflict resolution mode.

   * "Unintentional" merge commits are what some call "evil".

   <pre><strong>git pull --rebase</strong></pre>

   * To set it up so every branch you ever create on any repository is set to pull with rebase,
   set this global configuration:

   <pre><strong>git config --global pull.rebase true</strong></pre>

   Prior to version 1.7, it was:

   <pre><strong>git config --global branch.autosetuprebase always</strong></pre>


   <a name="Fetch"></a>

   ### Fetch

   So many prefer to take it one step at a time -- 

0. first a 

   <pre><strong>git fetch upstream
   </strong></pre> 

0. then a 

   <pre><strong>git checkout master</strong></pre>

   [ <a href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/git-shortcuts#gfu">gfu is the shortcut</a> ]


   <a name="GitK"></a>

   ### gitk for diff

   Now we can use a utility such as <strong>gitk</strong> to see what changes came in. 

   * Click the commit listed at the top of the list, which is the most recent commit.

   * Alternately, there is also utilities vimdiff, meld, difftool, etc. 

   * For Linux: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gitg/

   * To see the difference between what is in last commit vs. what's in the working folder:<br />
   <pre>git difftool</pre>

   * To see the difference between what is in last commit vs. what's added in the index cache:<br />
   <pre>git difftool --cached</pre>

   * You can make a default command such as this to explicitly specify some file to compare:<br />
   <pre>git diff HEAD HEAD^ -- <em>file1</em></pre><br />
   

   <a name="Merge"></a>

   ### git merge

0. If they don't affect you:

   <pre><strong>git merge upstream/master
   </strong></pre>

   Notice the slash separator between the upstream remote and 
   the upstream branch (master).

   CAUTION: Once you start a merge, nothing else can be done until you reconcile
   ALL conflicts. One cannot save a partially-resolved merge.
   There is no way yet of testing a partially merged tree.
   You can't go back if you make a mistake.


   [ <a href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/git-whoops#Merge">Whoops</a> ]


0. Use a cat or less command to verify file contents after merging:

   <pre><strong>cat README.md
   </strong></pre>


   <a name="PushOrigin"></a>

   ### git push origin master

0. git push to update origin master on our forked repository.

   There are variations to these commands, but this is the typical workflow.

   [ <a href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/git-whoops#PushOrigin">Whoops</a> ]


   <a name="Tag"></a>

   ### Tag

0. To make specific commits easier to find,
   add a tag to the latest commit so that it travels with that commit:

   <pre><strong>git tag -a v1.2.3</strong></pre>

   The example here is called a semantic tag described in the website 
   <a target="_blank" href="http://semver.org/">http://semver.org</a>


0. Tags are pushed using its own separate command:

   <pre><strong>git push --tags</strong></pre>


   ### File a pull request from git command line

0. Request the pull from the upstream repo. For example: 

   <pre><strong>git request-pull v1.0 https://github.com/<em>upstream/sisters  master</em>
   </strong></pre>

   * The URL must be specified (rather than a remote designator such as "upstream").

   * This feature is described at: <a target="_blank" href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-request-pull">
   http://git-scm.com/docs/git-request-pull</a> which says
   "this will produce a request to the upstream, summarizing the changes 
   <strong>between</strong> the v1.0 release and your master,
   to pull it from your public repository."

   See https://about.gitlab.com/2016/12/01/how-to-keep-your-fork-up-to-date-with-its-origin/


   <hr />

   <a name="MyRepoChange"></a>

   ### Changes in my repo

0. In GitHub, on a repo you can change,
   create a new branch named "sample1",
   create a new file, click the pencil to edit the file. 
   Save it.
   For example, create a new file and change something.

   Even if you are not working with a repo that others update,
   you yourself may update files on GitHub.

   <a name="MyRepoFetch"></a>
   
   ### Fetch my changes

0. Locally, when a team creates branches of the master, 
   everything that the team is working on can be seen with one command:

   <pre><strong>git fetch --dry-run
   </strong></pre>

   A sample response is 
   <a target="_blank" href="http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html">
   this from Scott Chacon</a>:

   <pre>

    </pre>

   PROTIP: Branches such as "origin/wild-renaming" in the sample above
   is a <strong>remote tracking branch</strong>.
   File in your working folders are not updated by git fetch, 
   which is the reason why we use it rather than git pull.
   Local branches don't have the remote prefix and slash.


   [ <a href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/git-whoops#Upstream">Whoops</a> ]


   ### Compare tracking branch

0. Before you fetch/pull, display incoming changes from remote origin master branch :

   <pre><strong>git log ^master origin/master
   </strong></pre>

   Nothing is returned if no changes were found.

0. To see the difference introduced by fetch:

   <pre><strong>gitk origin/master..master
   </strong></pre>

   Alterntely, some others prefer using 3rd-party merge utilities.

0. To display outgoing changes before you push:

   <pre><strong>git log master ^origin/master
   </strong></pre>


   <a name="MergeLocal"></a>

   ### Pull rebase

0. Use the Git utlity which resolves conflicts:
   It tries to find out which commits are really your local ones, and which had come from upstream in an earlier fetch.

   <pre><strong>git pull --rebase --autostash
   </strong></pre>

   As noted <a target="_blank" href="http://gitolite.com/git-pull--rebase">
   here</a>, this finds the starting point for rebase by 
   looking at the reflog of the remote tracking branch
   (the tips of successive git fetch operations on origin).

   * https://coderwall.com/p/7aymfa/please-oh-please-use-git-pull-rebase
   <br /><br />

   <strong>`--autostash`</strong> 
   (introduced in git 2.9 of June 2016) automatically performs stash commands 
   before the pull so that pull works even on "dirty" trees.
   The automatic commands are `git stash save` before the pull, 
   and then when done `git stash pop`. This added logic which solved a trap in
   automation via aliases such as:

   <pre><strike>git stash && git pull --rebase && git stash pop</strike></pre>

   If there's nothing to stash, the first command will do nothing, 
   but then stash pop will unstash some random stuff from before.

   CAUTION: There still may be changes introduced which cause a conflict when
   the stash pops after a successful rebase.
   An <a target="_blank" href="http://www.praqma.com/stories/git-autostash/">
   example</a>:

   <pre>
Created autostash: 094ad5c
HEAD is now at d39c25c repo1 - readme
First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Fast-forwarded master to 6b6e1d4262fd5bc8d2b974f81222003a6c67fea6.
Applying autostash resulted in conflicts.
Your changes are safe in the stash.
You can run "git stash pop" or "git stash drop" at any time.
   </pre>   

0. If you like the above approach enough to use it a lot, 
   create a Mac or Git alias.

   On a Mac, you can type only 3 letters (`gup`) by defining in your ~/.bash_profile:

   <pre>alias gup='git -c rebase.autoStash=true pull --rebase'
   </pre>

   Alternately, on any system, define this command:

   <pre>git config --global alias.up '!git pull --rebase --autostash'
   </pre>

   or

   <pre>git config --global alias.up '!git fetch && git rebase --autostash FETCH_HEAD'
   </pre>

   This would enable you to type only this (reminescant of Subversion):

   <pre><strong>git up
   </strong></pre>

   The above alias definitions obsoletes <a target="_blank" href="http://aanandprasad.com/git-up/">git-up</a> and
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/msiemens/PyGitUp">
   the Python port on Windows</a>
   as well as previous suggestion to define a global default
   (saved in the global .gitconfig file)
   which automatically inserts `--rebase` parameter onto 
   `git pull` commands:

   <pre><strong>git config branch.autosetuprebase always
   </strong></pre>

   <a target="_blank" href="https://x-team.com/blog/speed-up-your-github-workflow-with-hub/">
   This</a>
   describes installation and use of a simple wrapper around Git’s CLI so you can do it all from the command line rather than
   switching to GitHub’s web page:

## git-flow software

Saeed Noursalehi says at Microsoft
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKgBV4yfK3g&t=14m33s">*</a>
"hotfixes happen in topic branches off a release branch. 
All topic branches are merged using a pull request.".


Those who DO have permissions to update can use 
an approach described in a popular blog, which identified different types of updates at:<br />
<a target="_blank" href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">
http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model</a>

Each of these are a different type of branch:

   * Hotfix (from master and back to master)
   * Bugfix
   * Release - for next release development
   * Feature
   * Support

These branches are used more in corporate rather than open source software.

   <pre>git branch --set-upstream develop origin/master</pre>

0. Activate:

   <pre>git flow init -d</pre>

0. Answer the series of questions:

   <pre>
Which branch should be used for bringing forth production releases?
   - master
Branch name for production releases: [master] 
Branch name for "next release" development: [develop] 
&nbsp;
How to name your supporting branch prefixes?
Feature branches? [feature/] 
Release branches? [release/] 
Hotfix branches? [hotfix/] 
Support branches? [support/] 
Version tag prefix? [] 
   </pre>

0. View menu:

   <pre>git flow</pre>

   <pre>
usage: git flow <subcommand>

Available subcommands are:
   init      Initialize a new git repo with support for the branching model.
   feature   Manage your feature branches.
   release   Manage your release branches.
   hotfix    Manage your hotfix branches.
   support   Manage your support branches.
   version   Shows version information.
&nbsp;

   </pre>

0. Instead of native git commands
   the "git flow" command is issued with a new branch name:

   * <tt>git flow hotfix start <em>branchx</em></tt>
   * <tt>git flow bugfix start <em>branchx</em></tt>
   * <tt>git flow release start <em>branchx</em></tt>
   * <tt>git flow feature start <em>branchx</em></tt>
   * <tt>git flow support start <em>branchx</em></tt>

   A sample of the response:

   <pre>
Switched to a new branch 'feature/controller'
&nbsp;
Summary of actions:
- A new branch 'feature/branchx' was created, based on 'develop'
- You are now on branch 'feature/branchx'
&nbsp;
Now, start committing on your feature. When done, use:
&nbsp;
     git flow feature finish branchx
   <pre>

0. Edit files (such as generate controller).

0. List branches:

   <pre><strong>git-flow feature</strong></pre>

Summary of actions:
- A new remote branch 'feature/branchx' was created
- The local branch 'feature/branchx' was configured to track the remote branch
- You are now on branch 'feature/branchx'   
   </pre>

0. Instead of native git commands
   the "git flow" command is issued with a git flow branch name 
   and whether you want to  finish (git merge):

   * <tt>git flow hotfix finish <em>branchx</em></tt>
   * <tt>git flow bugfix finish <em>branchx</em></tt>
   * <tt>git flow release finish <em>branchx</em></tt>
   * <tt>git flow feature finish <em>branchx</em></tt>

<a target="_blank" href="https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/TheHubFlowTools.html">
   HubFlow</a>

   <pre>
git clone https://github.com/datasift/gitflow
