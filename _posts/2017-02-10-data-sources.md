Here is a list of data avaiable.

"Data is the crude oil of the 21st Century, and analytics is the combustion engine." --Gartner

I'd like to see how different people work on the same set of data:

## Images

### MNIST Number Images

Instead of downloading yourself, note that the 
<a target="_blank" href="http://docs.floydhub.com/guides/datasets/">
Floydhub.com</a> has these image datasets already on their servers for Machine Learning code use:

http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist</a><br />
On the website of the "Godfather of ML", Yann Lecun)</a>
is the "hello world" of deep learning --
55,000 28x28 pixel images of hand-written numbers (from 0 thru 9).
Each image is labeled with the number written in the image.
The "NIST" in "MNIST" is for the US National Institute of Technology.

   this</a> lists methods by their error rate.

   * The MNIST dataset comes pre-loaded in Keras, in the form of a set of four Numpy arrays,
   loaded using this code that references two sets of data -- the training set and testing set.

   <pre>from keras.datasets import mnist
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()
   </pre>

   The "shape" of an array is the number of items and pixel height and width:

   <pre>train_images.shape
(60000, 28, 28)</pre>
