This tutorial is a step-by-step hands-on introduction to use of Terraform for creating a cluster of web servers through a load balancer on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.

Terraform, at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html">terraform.io</a>, is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure in the cloud.

Repeatable. Versioned. Documented. Automated. Testable. Shareable.

## Competitors to Terraform

<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.gruntwork.io/why-we-use-terraform-and-not-chef-puppet-ansible-saltstack-or-cloudformation-7989dad2865c#.63ls7fpkq">NOTE</a>: Other IAC (Infrastructure as Code) tools include Chef, Puppet, Ansible, SaltStack, AWS CloudFormation.

<a target="_blank" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30870969-87e52558-a2a2-11e7-8cfa-454fe9081c64.png">

"Immutable" means servers are treated like "cattle" (removed from the herd) and not as "pets" (kept alive as long as possible).

Terraform also provides execution control, iterations, and (perhaps most of all) management of resources already created (desired state configuration) over several cloud providers (not just AWS).



## Installation #

   PROTIP: Terraform is written in the [Go language](/golang/), so there is no JVM to download as well.

### Consider tfenv

If you plan on frequently switching among several versions installed of Terraform:

   https://github.com/kamatama41/tfenv

### Install on MacOS

1. In a Terminal window:

   <tt><strong>brew install -g terraform

## Get Sample Terraform scripts

1. Install a Git client if you haven't already.
0. Use an internew browser (Chrome) to my sample PowerShell DSC scripts at:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wilsopnmar/terraform-starter">
   https://github.com/wilsonmar/terraform-starter.git</a>

   (I would be honored if you click Star)

0. Create a GitHub account for yourself if you haven't already.
0. Click the <strong>Fork</strong> button to make it yours, since you may be making changes.
0. Create or navigate to a container folder where new repositories are added. For example:

   `~/gits/wilsonmar/terraform`

0. Get my sample PowerShell scripts onto your laptop (substituting "wilsonmar" with your own account name):

   <tt><strong>git clone <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wilsopnmar/terraform-starter">
   https://github.com/wilsonmar/terraform-starter.git</a> \-\-depth=1 && 
   cd terraform-starter
   </strong></tt>

   The above is one line, but may be word-wrapped on your screen.

   The response at time of writing:

   <pre>
Cloning into 'terraform-starter'...
remote: Counting objects: 12, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (12/12), done.
remote: Total 12 (delta 1), reused 9 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (12/12), done.
   </pre>  


   ### Other scripts

   These scripts is a combination of scripts prepared by several helpful people:

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/intro-to-terraform">
   https://github.com/gruntwork-io/intro-to-terraform.git</a>

   * https://github.com/brikis98/infrastructure-as-code-talk/tree/master/terraform-configurations

   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/intro-to-terraform">
   https://github.com/gruntwork-io/intro-to-terraform.git</a>

   TODO: The sample scripts referenced by this tutorial contain moustache variable mark-up so that you can generate a set for your organization.

   https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/r/virtual_machine_scale_set.html


   ### Environment folders Validate 

   PROTIP: Separate Terraform configurations by a folder for each environment.

   * base
   * dev 
   * loadtest (performance testing)
   * stage
   * uat (User Acceptance Testing)
   * prod
   <br /><br />

0. Navigate into the base folder.

   PROTIP: Terraform acts only on the current directory, and does not recurse into sub directories.

0. View the development.tfvars file:

   <pre>
environment_tag = "dev"
tenant_id = "223d"
billing_code_tag = "DEV12345"
dns_site_name = "dev-web"
dns_zone_name = "mycorp.xyz"
dns_resource_group = "DNS"
instance_count = "2"
subnet_count = "2"
   </pre>

   The production.tfvars file usually instead contain more instances and thus subnets that go through a load balancer for auto-scaling:

   <pre>
environment_tag = "prod"
tenant_id = "223d"
billing_code_tag = "PROD12345"
dns_site_name = "marketing"
dns_zone_name = "mycorp.com"
dns_resource_group = "DNS"
instance_count = "6"
subnet_count = "3"
   </pre>

   All these would use `main_config.tf` and variables.tf files that are commonly used for all environments:

   https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/validate.html

0. Navigate into

0. Validate the folder:

   <tt><strong>terraform validate 
   </strong></tt>

   If no issues are identified, no message appears. (no news is good news)



   <a name="TerraformInit"></a>

   ### Plug-in Initialization

   Providers are not included with the installer, so...

0. Initialize Terraform plug-ins:

   <tt><strong>terraform init
   </strong></tt>

   Response:

   <pre>
Initializing provider plugins...
- Checking for available provider plugins on https://releases.hashicorp.com...
- Downloading plugin for provider "aws" (0.1.4)...   
&nbsp;
The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
so the latest version was installed.
&nbsp;
To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
changes, it is recommended to add version = "..." constraints to the
corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings
suggested below.
&nbsp;
* provider.aws: version = "~> 0.1"
&nbsp;
Terraform has been successfully initialized!
&nbsp;
You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.
&nbsp;
If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
   </pre>


   ### .tf files

0. Navigate into one of the folders (in the case of the example repo):

   <tt><strong>cd single-web-server
   </strong></tt>

0. Open folder using Atom or list files:

   <tt><strong>ls -al
   </strong></tt>




   ### Main.tf

   PROTIP: There should be only one <strong>main.tf</strong> per folder.

   NOTE: Terraform files coded end with <strong>.tf</strong> file type.

0. Edit file <strong>main.tf</strong>. Widen the screen width to avoid wrapping.

   <a name="HCL"></a>

   Both CloudFormation and Terraform work with JSON, but Terraform works with HCL (Hashicorp Configuratio Language) that is both human and machine friendly. https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl and described at https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax.html

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax.html">
   NOTE</a>: Terraform code is written in a language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language). It's less verbose than JSON and more concise than YML.

   Unlike JSON and YML, HCL allows annotations as in bash scripts: Single line comments start with # (pound sign).<br />
   Multi-line comments are wrapped between /* and \*/. Values can be interpolated usning syntax wrapped in $\{\}, in the format of $\{type.name.attribute\}. Literal $ are coded by doubling up $$.

   Back-slashes specify continuation.

   More importantly, tf files are <strong>declarative</strong>, meaning that they define the desired end-state (outcomes). If 15 servers are declared, Terraform automatically adds or removes servers to end up with 15 servers rather than specifying procedures to invoke (such as add 5 servers). Terraform know how many servers it has setup already.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform-old/">
   Paid Pro and Premium licenses of Terraform</a>
   add version control integration, MFA security, and other enterprise features.

   HCL does not have conditional if/else logic, which is why modules are necessary.


   <a name="Providers"></a>

   ## Cloud Providers

   Terraform providers reference APIs. Examples are AWS, Google, Azure, Kubernetes, GitLab, DigitalOcean, Heroku, GitHub, OpenStack.

   https://github.com/terraform-providers

   https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/tree/master/builtin/providers

0. https://aws.amazon.com/

   Metadata related to each provider are defined like this:

   <pre>
provider "aws" {
  alias = "NorthEast"
  region = "us-east-1"
  instance_type = "t1.micro"
}
   </pre>

   resource definitions specify the desired state of resources.

   "t1.micro" qualifies for the Amazon free tier available to first-year subscribers.

   NOTE: Components of Terrform are: provider, resource, provision.


   ### Provisioners

   Provisioners configurations are also plugins:

   Provisioner definitions define the properties of each resource, such as initialization commands. For example, this installs an nginx web server and displays a minimal HTML page:

   <pre>
provisioner "remote-exec" {
  inline = [
    "sudo yum install nginx -y",
    "sudo service nginx start",
    "echo "<html><head><title><title>NGINX server</title></head><body style=\"background-color"></body></html>"
  ]
}
   </pre>


0. PROTIP: Make sure that the AWS region is what you want.

   https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/instance.html
   AWS provider

   NOTE: The contents of the repo were written based on Terraform 0.7.x.

0. Variables file:

   `vars.tf` file contains specifcation of values to variables, such as the server port (8080).

   ### Defaults and lookup function

   PROTIP: Variables can be assigned multiple default values selected by a lookup function:

   <pre>
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
# export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=xx-yyyy-0
&nbsp;
variable "server_port" {
  description = "The port the server will use for HTTP requests"
  default = 8080
}
variable "amis" {
  type = "map‚Äù"
  default = {
    us-east-1 = "ami-1234"
    us-west-1 = "ami-5678"
  }
}
ami = ${lookup(var.amis, "us-east-1")}
   </pre>

   PROTIP: With AWS EC2, the us-east-1 region must be used as the basis for creating others.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.aws.amazon.com%2FAWSEC2%2Flatest%2FUserGuide%2Flaunch-marketplace-console.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGbWvcSfsheH4psSFED8ZF-w6mrqQ">NOTE</a>: Amazon has an approval process for making AMIs available on the public Amazon Marketplace.


   ### CIDR Subnet function

   <pre>
variable network_info {
   default = ‚Äú10.0.0.0/8‚Äù #type, default, description
}
cidr_block = ${cidrsubnet(var.network_info, 8, 1)} # returns 10.1.0.0/16
cidr_block = ${cidrsubnet(var.network_info, 8, 2)} # returns 10.2.0.0/16
     </pre>


   <pre>
variable network_info {
   default = ‚Äú10.0.0.0/8‚Äù #type, default, description
}
cidr_block = ${cidrsubnet(var.network_info, 8, 1)} # returns 10.1.0.0/16
cidr_block = ${cidrsubnet(var.network_info, 8, 2)} # returns 10.2.0.0/16
     </pre>

   In this example terraform.tfvars file are credentials for both AWS EC2 and Azure ARM providers:

   <pre>
bucket_name = "mycompany-sys1-v1"
arm_subscription_id = "???"
arm_principal = "???"
arm_passsord = "???"
tenant_id = "223d"
aws_access_key = "insert access key here>"
aws_secret_key = "insert secret key here"
private_key_path = "C:\\MyKeys1.pem"
   </pre>

   The `private_key_path` should be a full path, containing `\\` so that the single slash is not interpreted as a special character.

   `bucket_name` must be globally unique within all of the AWS provider customers.


   ### Terraforming AWS Configuration

   PROTIP: Install from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dtan4/terraforming">
   https://github.com/dtan4/terraforming</a>
   a Ruby script that enables a command such as:   

   <tt><strong>terraforming s3 \-\-profile dev
   </strong></tt>

   You can pass profile name by --profile option.


   <a name="TerraformPlan"></a>

   ### Terraform Plan

0. Have Terrform evaluate based on vars in a different (parent) folder:

   <tt><strong>terraform plan -var-file='..\terraform.tfvars' -var-file='.\Development\development.tfvars' -state='.\Development\dev.state'
   </strong></tt>

   The two dots in the command specifies to look above the current folder.

   A sample response:

   <pre>"&LT;computered>" means Terraform figures it out.
   </pre>

   <a name="Output"></a>

   ### Output

   `outputs.tf` file 

   <pre>
output "aws_elb_public_dns" {
  value = "${aws_elb.web.dns_name}"
}
output "public_ip" {
  value = "${aws_instance.example.public_ip}"
}
output "azure_rm_dns_cname" {
  value = "${azurerm_dns_cname_record.elb.id}"
}
   </pre>

0. PROTIP: If the AMI is no longer available, you will get an error message.


   ### Terraform apply

   <tt><strong>
   terraform apply -state=".\develop\dev.state" -var="environment_name=development"
   </strong></tt>


   1. Generate model from logical definition (the Desired State).
   2. Load current model (preliminary source data).
   3. Refresh current state model by querying remote provider (final source state).
   4. Calculate difference from source state to target state (plan).
   5. Apply plan.
   <br /><br />


   <a name="State"></a>

   ### Ignore state files

   Terraform apply generates <strong>.tfstate</strong> files (containing JSON) to persist the state of runs. It contains a maps resources IDs to their data. 

0. View the `.gitignore` file:

   <pre>
terraform.tfstate*
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.backup
.terraform/
*.iml
*.plan
vpc
   </pre>

   CAUTION: State files can contain secrets.

   `.terraform/` specifies that the folder is ignored when pushing to GitHub.

   Terraform apply creates a dev.state.lock.info file as a way to signal to other processes to stay away while changes to the environment are underway.

   `tfstate.backup` is created from the most recent previous execution before the current `tfstate` file contents.


   ### Remote state

   <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-to-manage-terraform-state-28f5697e68fa">NOTE</a>
   terraform.tfstate can be stored over the network in S3, etcd distributed key value store (used by Kubernetes), or a Hashicorp Atlas or Consul server. 

   Hashicorp Atlas is a licensed solution.

   State can be obtained using command:

   `terraform remote pull`


0. `vars.tf` file contains specifcation of values to variables, such as the server port (8080).

   <pre>
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

variable "server_port" {
  description = "The port the server will use for HTTP requests"
  default = 8080
}
    </pre>

   `outputs.tf` file 

   <pre>
output "public_ip" {
  value = "${aws_instance.example.public_ip}"
}
   </pre>

0. PROTIP: Make sure that the AWS region is what you want.

   https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/instance.html
   AWS provider

   NOTE: The contents of the repo were written based on Terraform 0.7.x.

0. PROTIP: If the AMI is no longer available, you will get an error message.

    <pre>ami = "ami-2d39803a"</pre>



   ### Terraform Plan

0. Have Terrform evaluate based on vars in a different (parent) folder:

   <tt><strong>terraform plan -var-file='..\terraform.tfvars'
   </strong></tt>

   In the sample response:

   Pluses and minuses flag additions and deletions. This is a key differentiator for Terraform as a ""

   "&LT;computered>" means Terraform figures it out.


   Terraform creates a dependency graph (specfically, a Directed Acyclic Graph).
   This is so that nodes are built in the order they are needed. 


   ### Version

0. Obtain version installed:

   <tt><strong>terraform version 
   	</strong></tt>

   Alternately:

   <tt><strong>terraform \-\-version 
   	</strong></tt>

   WARNING: The response at time of writing, Terraform is not even "1.0" release, meaning it's in beta maturity.:

   <pre>
   Terraform v0.10.6
   </pre>

   QUESTION: Pace of change in Terraform?

   Release 0.6.8 (2.12.2015)

   TODO: Update terraform

    </strong></tt>


   ### Environment variables

0. Define enviornment variables:

   <pre>
   TF_VAR_first_name=John terraform apply
   </pre>

0. Define Terraform variable:

   <pre>
   terraform apply -var 'first_name=John' -var 'last_name=Bunyan'
   </pre>

   Values to Terraform variables define inputs such as run-time DNS/IP addresses into Terraform modules.

   NOTE: Built-in functions:

   https://terraform.io/docs/configuration/interpolation.html


   ### Apps to install

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/runs/installing-software.html">NOTE</a>: Software can be specified for installation using Packer's `local-exec` provisioner which has Terraform on host machines executes commands. For example, on a Ubuntu machine:

   <pre>
resource "null_resource" "local-software" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = <<EOH
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ansible
EOH
  }
}
   </pre>

   NOTE: apt-get is in-built within Ubuntu Linux distributions.

   PROTIP: Use this to bootstrap automation such as assigning permissions and running Ansible or PowerShell DSC, then use DSC scripts for more flexibility and easier debugging.


   ### Output variables #

0. Output Terraform variable:

   <pre>
output "loadbalancer_dns_name" {
  value = "${aws_elb.loadbalancer.dns_name}"
}
   </pre>

   ### Processing flags

   HCL can contain flags that affect processing. For example, within a resource specification, `force_destroy = true` forces the provider to delete the resource when done.


   ### Verify websites

0. The website accessible?

0. In the provider's console (EC2), verify


   ### Destroy to clean up

0. Destroy instances so they don't rack up charges unproductively:

   <tt><strong>terraform destroy
   </strong></tt>

   PROTIP: Amazon charges by the hour while others charge by the minute.

0. Verify in the provider's console.


## Terraform Console

0. On Windows, open the Terraform Console from a <strong>command Prompt</strong> rather than from within PowerShell.

   <tt><strong>terraform console</strong></tt>

   element(list("one","two","three"),0,2)

   The response is (because counting begins from zero):

   three

   element(list("one","two","three"),0,2)

   one,
   two
   

## Automation

   NOTE: Automating infrastructure deployment consists of:

   * Provisioning resources
   * Planning updates
   * Using source control
   * Reusing templates
   <br /><br />

  PROTIP: Terrform files are "idempotent" (repeat runs don't change anything if nothing is changed). Thus Terraform defines the "desired state configuration".

   NOTE: Terraform remote configures remote state storage with Terraform.

## Modules

https://github.com/terraform-community-modules

https://github.com/objectpartners/tf-modules

   <pre>
module "rancher" {
  source = "github.com/objectpartners/tf-modules//rancher/server-standalone-elb-db&ref=9b2e590"
}
   </pre>

   The double slashes separate the repo from the subdirectory.

   The ref is a commit ID

   builds Docker containers for using the terraform command line program.


## Plugins into Terraform

All Terraform providers are plugins - multi-process RPC (Remote Procedure Calls).

   https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/plugin

   https://terraform.io/docs/plugins/index.html

Terraform expect plugins to follow a very specific naming convention of terraform-TYPE-NAME. For example, terraform-provider-aws, which tells Terraform that the plugin is a provider that can be referenced as "aws".

PROTIP: Establish a standard for where plugins are located:

For \*nix systems, `~/.terraformrc`

For Windows, `%APPDATA%/terraform.rc`

https://www.terraform.io/docs/internals/internal-plugins.html

PROTIP: When writing your own terraform plugin, create a new Go project in GitHub, then locally use a  directory structure:

   `$GOPATH/src/github.com/USERNAME/terraform-NAME`

where USERNAME is your GitHub username and NAME is the name of the plugin you're developing. This structure is what Go expects and simplifies things down the road.
