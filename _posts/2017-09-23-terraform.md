This tutorial is a step-by-step hands-on introduction to use of Terraform for creating a cluster of web servers through a load balancer on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.

Terraform, at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html">terraform.io</a>, is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure in the cloud.

Repeatable. Versioned. Documented. Automated. Testable. Shareable.

## Infrastructure as Code Compared

The difference between Chef, Puppet, Ansible, SaltStack, AWS CloudFormation, and Terraform:

<a target="_blank" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30870969-87e52558-a2a2-11e7-8cfa-454fe9081c64.png">
<img alt="terraform-comp-colored-650x261-36439" width="650" height="261" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30870914-62437728-a2a2-11e7-8e6a-e3c847f7984f.jpg"><small>(Click to pop-up full screen image <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.gruntwork.io/why-we-use-terraform-and-not-chef-puppet-ansible-saltstack-or-cloudformation-7989dad2865c#.63ls7fpkq">from Gruntwork</a>)</small></a>

"Immutable" means once instantiated, it doesn't change. In DevOps, this strategy means individual servers are treated like "cattle" (removed from the herd) and not as "pets" (kept alive as long as possible).

Terraform also provides execution control, iterations, and (perhaps most of all) management of resources already created (desired state configuration) over several cloud providers (not just AWS).

## Installation #

   PROTIP: Terraform is written in the [Go language](/golang/), so there is no JVM to download as well.

### Install on MacOS

If you plan on frequently switching among several versions installed of Terraform:

   <a target="_blank" href="
   https://github.com/kamatama41/tfenv">
   https://github.com/kamatama41/tfenv</a>

   <tt><strong>brew install tfenv
   </strong></tt>

   The response at time of writing:

## Automation

   NOTE: Automating infrastructure deployment consists of these features:

   * Provisioning resources
   * Planning updates
   * Using source control
   * Reusing templates
   <br /><br />

  PROTIP: Terrform files are "idempotent" (repeat runs don't change anything if nothing is changed). 
  Thus Terraform defines the "desired state configuration".

   NOTE: Terraform remote configures remote state storage with Terraform.

## Get Sample Terraform scripts

The steps below are based on
   <a target="_blank" href="
   https://www.terraform.io/intro/examples/">
   https://www.terraform.io/intro/examples</a>
and implemented in the setup scripts at:
   <a target="_blank" href="
   https://github.com/wilsonmar/mac-setup/">
   https://github.com/wilsonmar/mac-setup</a>
which performs the following steps for you:

1. Install a Git client if you haven't already.
0. Use an internet browser (Chrome) to see the sample assets at:

   <a target="_blank" href="
   https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws.git">
   https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws.git</a>

0. If you are going to make changes, click the <strong>Fork</strong> button.
0. Create or navigate to a container folder where new repositories are added. For example:

   `~/gits/wilsonmar/tf-sample`

0. Get the repo onto your laptop (substituting "wilsonmar" with your own account name):

   <tt><strong>git clone <a target="_blank" href="
   https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws.git">
   https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws.git</a> \-\-depth=1 && 
   cd tf-sample
   </strong></tt>

   The above is one line, but may be word-wrapped on your screen.

   The response at time of writing:

   <pre>
Cloning into 'tf-sample'...
remote: Counting objects: 12, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (12/12), done.
remote: Total 12 (delta 1), reused 9 (delta 0), pack-reused 0

   ### Validate .tf files

1. Navigate into the repo and view files in:

   <tt><strong>ls single-web-server
   </strong></tt>

   The contents:

   <pre>README.md    main.tf      outputs.tf   variables.tf</pre>

0. Validate the <strong>folder</strong> using <a target="_blank" href="
   https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/validate.html">
   https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/validate.html</a>

   <tt><strong>terraform validate single-web-server
   </strong></tt>

   If no issues are identified, no message appears. (no news is good news)

   pre-commit hook to validate in your Git repository</a>


   ### Main.tf

   PROTIP: There should be only one <strong>main.tf</strong> per folder.

   NOTE: Terraform files coded end with <strong>.tf</strong> file type.

0. Edit file <strong>main.tf</strong>. Widen the screen width to avoid wrapping.

   <a name="HCL"></a>

   ### HCL (Hashicorp Configuratio Language) 

   Terraform works with HCL (Hashicorp Configuratio Language) that is both human and machine friendly. https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl and described at <a target="_blank" href="
   https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax.html">
   https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax.html</a>

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax.html">
   NOTE</a>: Terraform code is written in a language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language). 
   It's less verbose than JSON and more concise than YML.

   Unlike JSON and YML, <strong>HCL allows annotations</strong> as in bash scripts:<br />
   single line comments start with # (pound sign).<br />
   Multi-line comments are wrapped between /* and \*/. 

   Values can be interpolated usning syntax wrapped in $\{\}, called interpolation syntax, in the format of $\{type.name.attribute\}. Literal $ are coded by doubling up $$. For example, $\{aws.instance.base.id\} is interpolated to something like `i-28978a2`.

   Back-slashes specify continuation (as in Bash).

   More importantly, tf files are <strong>declarative</strong>, meaning that they define the desired end-state (outcomes). If 15 servers are declared, Terraform automatically adds or removes servers to end up with 15 servers rather than specifying procedures to add 5 servers. 
   
   Terraform can do that because it knows how many servers it has setup already.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform-old/">
   Paid Pro and Premium licenses of Terraform</a>
   add version control integration, MFA security, and other enterprise features.

   HCL does not have conditional if/else logic, which is why <a href="#Modules">modules</a> are necessary.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl2">HCL2</a>
   combines the interpolation language HIL to produce a single configuration language that supports arbitrary expressions.
   It's not backward compatible, with no direct migration path.

   ### Environment folders  

   PROTIP: Separate Terraform configurations by a folder for each environment.

   * base (template for making changes)
   * dev 
   * loadtest (performance/stress testing)
   * stage
   * uat (User Acceptance Testing)
   * prod
   * demo (demostration used by salespeople)
   * train (for training users)
   <br /><br />

0. Navigate into the base folder.

   PROTIP: Terraform commands act only on the current directory, and does not recurse into sub directories.

   ## tfvars
   
0. View the development.tfvars file:

   <pre>
environment_tag = "dev"
tenant_id = "223d"
billing_code_tag = "DEV12345"
dns_site_name = "dev-web"
dns_zone_name = "mycorp.xyz"
dns_resource_group = "DNS"
instance_count = "2"
subnet_count = "2"
   </pre>

   The production.tfvars file usually instead contain more instances and thus subnets that go through a load balancer for auto-scaling:

   <pre>
environment_tag = "prod"
tenant_id = "223d"
billing_code_tag = "PROD12345"
dns_site_name = "marketing"
dns_zone_name = "mycorp.com"
dns_resource_group = "DNS"
instance_count = "6"
subnet_count = "3"
   </pre>

   All these would use `main_config.tf` and variables.tf files that are commonly used for all environments:


   <a name="TerraformInit"></a>

   ### Plug-in Initialization

   Providers are not included with the installer, so...

0. Initialize Terraform plug-ins:

   <tt><strong>terraform init
   </strong></tt>

   Response:

   <pre>
Initializing provider plugins...
- Checking for available provider plugins on https://releases.hashicorp.com...
- Downloading plugin for provider "aws" (0.1.4)...   
&nbsp;
The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
so the latest version was installed.
&nbsp;
To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
changes, it is recommended to add version = "..." constraints to the
corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings
suggested below.
&nbsp;
* provider.aws: version = "~> 0.1"
&nbsp;
Terraform has been successfully initialized!
&nbsp;
You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.
&nbsp;
If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
   </pre>

   This creates a hidden `.terraform\plugins" folder path containing a folder for your os - `darwin_amd64` for MacOS.


   <a name="Providers"></a>

   ## Cloud Providers

   Terraform providers reference APIs. Examples are AWS, Google, Azure, Kubernetes, GitLab, DigitalOcean, Heroku, GitHub, OpenStack.

   <a target="_blak" href="
   https://github.com/terraform-providers">
   https://github.com/terraform-providers</a>

   <a target="_blank" href="
   https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/tree/master/builtin/providers">
   https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/tree/master/builtin/providers</a>

0. Metadata related to each provider are defined like this:

   <pre>
provider "aws" {
  alias = "NorthEast"
  region = "us-east-1"
  instance_type = "t1.micro"
}
   </pre>

   resource definitions specify the desired state of resources.

   "t1.micro" qualifies for the Amazon free tier available to first-year subscribers.

   NOTE: Components of Terrform are: provider, resource, provision.


   ### Provisioners

   Provisioners configurations are also plugins:

   Provisioner definitions define the properties of each resource, such as initialization commands. For example, this installs an nginx web server and displays a minimal HTML page:

   <pre>
provisioner "remote-exec" {
  inline = [
    "sudo yum install nginx -y",
    "sudo service nginx start",
    "echo "<html><head><title><title>NGINX server</title></head><body style=\"background-color"></body></html>"
  ]
}
   </pre>


0. PROTIP: Make sure that the AWS region is what you want.

   <a target="_blank" href="
   https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/instance.html">
   https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/instance.html</a>
   AWS provider

   NOTE: The contents of the repo were written based on Terraform 0.7.x.

0. Variables file:

   <tt>vars.tf</tt> file specifies values to variables, such as the server port (8080).

   ### Defaults and lookup function

   PROTIP: Variables can be assigned multiple default values selected by a lookup function:

   <pre>
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
# export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=xx-yyyy-0
&nbsp;
variable "server_port" {
  description = "The port the server will use for HTTP requests"
  default = 8080
}
variable "amis" {
  type = "map‚Äù"
  default = {
    us-east-1 = "ami-1234"
    us-west-1 = "ami-5678"
  }
}
ami = ${lookup(var.amis, "us-east-1")}
   </pre>

   PROTIP: With AWS EC2, region "us-east-1" must be used as the basis for creating others.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.aws.amazon.com%2FAWSEC2%2Flatest%2FUserGuide%2Flaunch-marketplace-console.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGbWvcSfsheH4psSFED8ZF-w6mrqQ">NOTE</a>: Amazon has an approval process for making AMIs available on the public Amazon Marketplace.


   ### CIDR Subnet function

   <pre>
variable network_info {
   default = ‚Äú10.0.0.0/8‚Äù #type, default, description
}
cidr_block = ${cidrsubnet(var.network_info, 8, 1)} # returns 10.1.0.0/16
cidr_block = ${cidrsubnet(var.network_info, 8, 2)} # returns 10.2.0.0/16
     </pre>


   <pre>
variable network_info {
   default = ‚Äú10.0.0.0/8‚Äù #type, default, description
}
cidr_block = ${cidrsubnet(var.network_info, 8, 1)} # returns 10.1.0.0/16
cidr_block = ${cidrsubnet(var.network_info, 8, 2)} # returns 10.2.0.0/16
     </pre>

   In this example terraform.tfvars file are credentials for both AWS EC2 and Azure ARM providers:

   <pre>
bucket_name = "mycompany-sys1-v1"
arm_subscription_id = "???"
arm_principal = "???"
arm_passsord = "???"
tenant_id = "223d"
aws_access_key = "insert access key here>"
aws_secret_key = "insert secret key here"
private_key_path = "C:\\MyKeys1.pem"
   </pre>

   The `private_key_path` should be a full path, containing `\\` so that the single slash is not interpreted as a special character.

   `bucket_name` must be globally unique within all of the AWS provider customers.


   ### Terraforming AWS Configuration

   PROTIP: Install from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dtan4/terraforming">
   https://github.com/dtan4/terraforming</a>
   a Ruby script that enables a command such as:   

   <tt><strong>terraforming s3 \-\-profile dev
   </strong></tt>

   You can pass profile name by --profile option.


   <a name="TerraformPlan"></a>

   ### Terraform Plan

0. Have Terrform evaluate based on vars in a different (parent) folder:

   <tt><strong>terraform plan -var-file='..\terraform.tfvars' -var-file='.\Development\development.tfvars' -state='.\Development\dev.state' -out base-`date-+'%s'`.plan
   </strong></tt>

   The two dots in the command specifies to look above the current folder.

   The `-out` parameter outputs to a file name that begins with `base-` and ends with .plan. The date is like 147772345 which is the numer of seconds since 1/1/1970.

   A sample response:

   <pre>"&LT;computered>" means Terraform figures it out.
   </pre>

   <a name="Output"></a>

   ### Output

   `outputs.tf` file 

   <pre>
output "aws_elb_public_dns" {
  value = "${aws_elb.web.dns_name}"
}
output "public_ip" {
  value = "${aws_instance.example.public_ip}"
}
output "azure_rm_dns_cname" {
  value = "${azurerm_dns_cname_record.elb.id}"
}
   </pre>

0. PROTIP: If the AMI is no longer available, you will get an error message.


   ### Terraform apply

   <tt><strong>
   terraform apply -state=".\develop\dev.state" -var="environment_name=development"
   </strong></tt>


   1. Generate model from logical definition (the Desired State).
   2. Load current model (preliminary source data).
   3. Refresh current state model by querying remote provider (final source state).
   4. Calculate difference from source state to target state (plan).
   5. Apply plan.
   <br /><br />


   <a name="State"></a>

   ### Ignore state files

   Terraform apply generates <strong>.tfstate</strong> files (containing JSON) to persist the state of runs. 
   It maps resources IDs to their data. 

0. In the `.gitignore` file are files generated during processing, so don't need to persist in a repository:

   <pre>
terraform.tfstate*
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.backup
.terraform/
*.iml
*.plan
vpc
   </pre>

   CAUTION: tfstate files can contain secrets, so delete them before git add.

   `tfstate.backup` is created from the most recent previous execution before the current `tfstate` file contents.

   `.terraform/` specifies that the folder is ignored when pushing to GitHub.

   Terraform apply creates a <tt>dev.state.lock.info</tt> file as a way to signal to other processes to stay away while changes to the environment are underway.


   ### Remote state

   <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-to-manage-terraform-state-28f5697e68fa">NOTE</a>
   terraform.tfstate can be stored over the network in S3, etcd distributed key value store (used by Kubernetes), or a Hashicorp Atlas or Consul server. 

   Hashicorp Atlas is a licensed solution.

   State can be obtained using command:

   `terraform remote pull`


0. `vars.tf` file contains specifcation of values to variables, such as the server port (8080).

   <pre>
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

variable "server_port" {
  description = "The port the server will use for HTTP requests"
  default = 8080
}
    </pre>

   `outputs.tf` file 

   <pre>
output "public_ip" {
  value = "${aws_instance.example.public_ip}"
}
   </pre>

0. PROTIP: Make sure that the AWS region is what you want.

   https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/instance.html
   AWS provider

   NOTE: The contents of the repo were written based on Terraform 0.7.x.

0. PROTIP: If the AMI is no longer available, you will get an error message.

    <pre>ami = "ami-2d39803a"</pre>



   ### Terraform Plan

0. Have Terrform evaluate based on vars in a different (parent) folder:

   <tt><strong>terraform plan -var-file='..\terraform.tfvars'
   </strong></tt>

   In the sample response:

   Pluses and minuses flag additions and deletions. This is a key differentiator for Terraform as a ""

   "&LT;computered>" means Terraform figures it out.


   Terraform creates a dependency graph (specfically, a Directed Acyclic Graph).
   This is so that nodes are built in the order they are needed. 


   ### Environment variables

0. Define enviornment variables:

   <pre>
   TF_VAR_first_name=John terraform apply
   </pre>

0. Define Terraform variable:

   <pre>
   terraform apply -var 'first_name=John' -var 'last_name=Bunyan'
   </pre>

   Values to Terraform variables define inputs such as run-time DNS/IP addresses into <a href="#Modules">Terraform modules</a>.

   NOTE: Built-in functions:

   <a target="_blank" href="
   https://terraform.io/docs/configuration/interpolation.html">
   https://terraform.io/docs/configuration/interpolation.html</a>


   ### Apps to install

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/runs/installing-software.html">NOTE</a>: Software can be specified for installation using Packer's `local-exec` provisioner which has Terraform on host machines executes commands. For example, on a Ubuntu machine:

   <pre>
resource "null_resource" "local-software" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = <<EOH
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ansible
EOH
  }
}
   </pre>

   NOTE: apt-get is in-built within Ubuntu Linux distributions.

   PROTIP: Use this to bootstrap automation such as assigning permissions and running Ansible or PowerShell DSC, then use DSC scripts for more flexibility and easier debugging.


   ### Output variables #

0. Output Terraform variable:

   <pre>
output "loadbalancer_dns_name" {
  value = "${aws_elb.loadbalancer.dns_name}"
}
   </pre>

   ### Processing flags

   HCL can contain flags that affect processing. For example, within a resource specification, 
   `force_destroy = true` forces the provider to delete the resource when done.


   ### Verify websites

0. The website accessible?

0. In the provider's console (EC2), verify


   ### Destroy to clean up

0. Destroy instances so they don't rack up charges unproductively:

   <tt><strong>terraform destroy
   </strong></tt>

   PROTIP: Amazon charges for Windows instances by the hour while it charges for Linux by the minute,
   as other cloud providers do.

0. Verify in the provider's console (aws.amazon.com)


## Terraform Console

1. Open the Terraform Console (REPL) from a Terminal/command shell:

   <tt><strong>terraform console</strong></tt>

   The response is <strong>></strong>.

   <pre>element(list("one","two","three"),0,2)</pre>

   The response is (because counting begins from zero):

   <pre>1:3: element: expected 2 arguments, got 3 in:</pre>
   
2. Type <tt>exit</tt> to return to Bash console mode.

## Plugins into Terraform

All Terraform providers are plugins - multi-process RPC (Remote Procedure Calls).

    <a target="_blank" href="
    https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/plugin">
    https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/plugin</a>

    <a target="_blank" href="
    https://terraform.io/docs/plugins/index.html">
    https://terraform.io/docs/plugins/index.html</a>

Terraform expect plugins to follow a very specific naming convention of terraform-TYPE-NAME. For example, terraform-provider-aws, which tells Terraform that the plugin is a provider that can be referenced as "aws".

PROTIP: Establish a standard for where plugins are located:

For \*nix systems, `~/.terraformrc`

For Windows, `%APPDATA%/terraform.rc`

   <a target="_blank" href="
   https://www.terraform.io/docs/internals/internal-plugins.html">
   https://www.terraform.io/docs/internals/internal-plugins.html</a>

PROTIP: When writing your own terraform plugin, create a new Go project in GitHub, then locally use a  directory structure:

   `$GOPATH/src/github.com/USERNAME/terraform-NAME`

where USERNAME is your GitHub username and NAME is the name of the plugin you're developing. This structure is what Go expects and simplifies things down the road.
