This is kinda like designing a place for living in outer space, where you're cramped into a small space
going where you don't know.

<a name="HighProfile"></a>

### High profile vans (for stand-up desk)

This is a must-have for me, and the whole reason for getting a van in which I can stand up.

https://www.ramtrucks.com/
Dodge Ram ProMaster High Roof models have 76" height with 159" wide wheel-base.

STRATEGY: Since I won't be sleep while I use the stand-up desk, put the desk above the bed.
But this means I have to always clean up my desk before going to sleep.

So is it worth the risk of tip-over when blown by a fast wind?

Alternately, have a pop-up installed.
This would be only for summer use, though.

- [ ] Big monitor to left of desk.

- [ ] Position TV for it to be watcheable from bed.

- [ ] Bed desk. (It's a hassle to converted desk to bed every day)

- [ ] Leg raiser (pillow bag containing clothes or extra fabric) to use bed as desk

- [ ] Knives on magnetic strips on wall

- [ ] <a target="_blank" href="http://www.prolineracks.com/bull-ring-4001-retractable-tie-downs.html">
   Retractable tie-downs</a>


## Van make and model

Vehicles high enough to allow passengers to <strong>stand up straight</strong>:

   * Chrysler vans auto-driver?

   * Sprinter vans from Dodge Ram or Mercedes

   * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ebay.com/gds/How-to-buy-USPS-used-Ford-Windstar-postal-service-van-/10000000176074044/g.html">
   Nissan NV3500</a> HD Cargo vans are $28K for a V6 engine.

   * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.freightlinersprinterusa.com/freightliner/"> 
   Frieghtliner</a> new are in the high $30-40K range.

   * Ford Transit Connect (made in Turkey)
    has a standard 169-hp 4-cylinder for 21 miles per gallon in the city and 29 mpg on the highway, 

   * Old Ford Winstar <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ebay.com/gds/How-to-buy-USPS-used-Ford-Windstar-postal-service-van-/10000000176074044/g.html">on Ebay</a>

   * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.government-fleet.com/list/tag/usps.aspx">
   Used U.S. Postal Service Ram Promaster vans sold by GSA</a>
   are great if you don't intended on driving far or be in extreme weather.
   They were professionally maintained (oil changes on time, etc.)

   In 2015 USPS make a 9,000 unit commitment for Ram ProMaster 2500 vans.
   They are powered by a gasoline 3.6L Pentastar V-6 engine that produces 280 hp and 260 lb.-ft. of torque. (while other countries buy electric vehicles)
   The USPS plans to hold on to this newer fleet of vehicles for at least the next twenty years.

   - Left hand drive only.
   - Back up monitor too easy to knock off the window.
   - Height of driver seat is not adjustable


   ### Sprinter vans

   WARNING: These are rear-wheel drive.
   Not so good for the snow.

<a name="Seat"></a>

### Seat

   STRATEGY: Get a passenger van, take out the seats and use the seat mounts.
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaN3yzcWQz8">*</a>

   ARRANGEMENT: Drivers seat pivots to table with another seat.

- [ ] Small fridge by drivers seat for cold drinks.

- [ ] <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmalslYVYqI&t=15m17s">

<a name="Flooring"></a>

### Flooring

Floors can be the most demanding of surfaces.
In addition to the same need for sound/heat/cold insulation, 
it also needs to be:

   * Spill waterproof so it can be hosed down (cleaned), so no gaps
   * Cushioning
   * smooth so people don't trip over bumps
   * grippy so people don't slip
   <br /><br />

Thus, I prefer no carpets.

- [ ] Drain to tank under carriage?



<a name="Insulation"></a>

### Insulation from Heat, Cold, Noise

Tools: Fine blade jigsaw.

Between studs: 

9 centimeters of insulation total for total R value of 11.2

1. [ ] Use 3M 80 glue spray (which can withstand high heat)
2. [ ] Thinner foam against metal - 1/2 inch layer 2 R value = 3.2
   - [ ] 1/8th inch foam and foil insulation R value = 3 
3. [ ] Reflectix
4. [ ] Tyvek tape
5. [ ] Thicker foam - 3/4 inch layer 1 polyisocyanurate insulation - R Value = 5 

   - [ ] <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eastwood.com/xmat-sound-deadening-18x32-inches-34-8-sq-ft.html">
   Eastwood thermocoustic barrier XMAT 18x32 inch</a>
   34.8 sq foot for $100. Rated at 30 degree temp reduction and 19 db sound reduction 

   #### Over studs:

6. - [ ] 4x8 foot Paneling or luan
7. 1/2 inch soft foam.
8. Face:

   - [ ] Slotted wood from Home Depot (bamboo) for "sauna look"
   - [ ] Felted panel

9. Snap caps to cover screws.

TIP: Have a gap running along the ceiling for plugs.

TIP: Have gaps along the sides for electrical plug strip.

Cork board wall insulate?


<a name="Security"></a>

## Security

Insulation of light and sound also means that occupants are <strong>isolated</strong> inside
-- blind and deaf about who is approaching (such as cops in the night).

- [ ] Proximity cameras and microphones outside. Video and speaker inside. IoT opportunity here.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/21/14691062/ups-drone-delivery-truck-test-completed-video">
   A drone popping out the roof</a>

- [ ] Speaker outside to talk to people? Auto-respond when away?

- [ ] strong door locks, but people can just break a window.

- [ ] Fire extenguisher

- [ ] Big safe lock inside a hidden door to keep cameras, etc.

- [ ] Automatic dongle

- [ ] Back-up camera (Garmin RV 760)

- [ ] Video recorder

- [ ] trash can with lid to contain the smell. Near the drivers seat overnigh to vent. Hides inside.

- [ ] A metal "garage door" that rolls over windows for protection against window break-ins.



<a name="Airflow"></a>

## Airflow Vent Outdoors

a) Disspant hot air out 
from top sucked down through electrical panel and battery area, which builds heat.

b) Vent Moist air from cooktop and shower area out.

c) Foul smelling air above toilet area out.

Vent under solar panel?

   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YbYfAH6ZRo

   STRATEGY: Put the hot air vent so it blows into the shower area.

- [ ] A large ceiling vent with slide-out screen and dark shade to keep out cold.

- [ ] Drone with camera can fly out of the large vent (and return).

- [ ] Route gas pipe through a heat exchanger to capture heat from car exhaust.

   - [ ] Fly screen around door.

- [ ] bug screen with a magnetic strip you could hang to keep bugs out 

- [ ] roof fan/escape hatch idea.

- [ ] <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXYPCozJUHg&t=5m50s">

Dometic air conditioning unit.


<a name="Storage"></a>

## Storage (Cabinetry)

BUILD STRATEGY: Lay out wires before paneling.

   STRATEGY: Use lighter aluminum rather than wood. 
   This requires more expensive welding, but is lighter.

   - [ ] Expose removeable sockets so cabinets can be attached in different arrangements.


ARRANGEMENT: Shoes near the door. 

STRATEGY: Store socks inside shoes, or in a bag with shoes.

STRATEGY: Store shoes separtely from clothing.

STRATEGY: Have a barrier between soiled (smelly) clothing from clean clothing,

- [ ] Stealth secure storage for expensive camera and Drone to take videos.

- [ ] Custom-made bag to take up space above steering wheel between dashboard and windshield,
   to use wasted space for storing extra clothing.
   STRATEGY: A cold/light barrier is needed at night for privacy.

   PROTIP: So boxes slide out easily, don't have a brace blocking it.

ARRANGEMENT: Space for hanging up coats and suits.
   Near the entrance.
   Does not need to be kept warm/cool.

   IDEA: Closet door open to block outside door and provide more insulation.

With minimal space, the variety of food choices are more limited.

- [ ] Paper towels hanger for easy access.

   SPACE: Space for storing extra paper goods becasuse they are sold in packs.

- [ ] Plastic cabinets are lightest?

- [ ] <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoUlcVBoOX4">
   Ball-bearing slidings on drawers</a> to hold 60 pounds each.

- [ ] <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXYPCozJUHg&t=6m40s">
   Bicycle storage tall so wheels don't have to come off</a>

- [ ] canned food rotation system takes too much room.

- [ ] windshield blinds built-in to the posts save the space of temporary covers
   and the hassle of making them fit correctly.

- [ ] Space for cowboy hats hung up?

- [ ] Space for socks, underwear

- [ ] Space for dirty laundry bag and laundry soap jug.

- [ ] Storage surface padded felt?

- [ ] Storage above foot of bed to use

<a name="Bed"></a>

## Bed

<a target="_blank" href="http://solokombis.com.ar/Articulos%20Tecnicos/Articulos_Tecnicos/Cama/Cama%20en%20Kombi%20VW.htm"><img align="right" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/34521415-9cd34da8-f05b-11e7-9115-dd940ead9b8b.GIF"></a>


INTRO: A bed is the key differentiator.

SACRIFICE: Size of bed.

* Twin "Single" 38" x 75"
* Twin XL 38" x 80" common in college dorms.
* Full 53" x 75"
* Queen 60" x 80"
* King 76" x 80"
<br /><br />

- [ ] Thick memory foam on a board.
   The board can be quite heavy.

   To keep flexible use,
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awwZ7N07w4w&t=1m37s">
   create a bed frame</a> (perhaps out of pipes?)
   with a base for the bed, cut from 4x8 birch plywood {$50}

   OPTION: A "Murphy bed" folds up against the wall to reclaim the floor space and get the bedding out of the way.

- [ ] Straps across bed for safety while the van is in motion.

- [ ] ELECTRICAL: For electric blanket, an electrical plug near foot of bed.
  Space for chord to controller of blanket.

- [ ] Storage Tubs under bed. http://amzn.to/2dm3yYr

- [ ] Storage: change of bedding. Extra blankets.

- [ ] $60 Aluminum track with O-rings to secure bike. http://amzn.to/2daW3oV

- [ ] $22 Envelop style stretchy cargo nets on plywood hold things in place.
   http://amzn.to/2dsi6uU
   But they make the place look messy.

- [ ] ARRANGEMENT: Controllers and switches reachable from sleeping position.


<hr />

<a name="Cooking"></a>

## Cooking

- [ ] Smoke and Carbon Monoxide alarm (from http://simplisafe.com)

If you're not planning on much cooking:

- [ ] Wood stove?

   There's something about a real wood burning fireplace that warms the heart.
   Maybe it's the infra-red.

   ![rv wood stove dryer](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/23333445/91b4b8ca-fb48-11e6-9d04-b9e8faf730e6.png)

- [ ] Origo alcohol stove meant for marine use. $240 new 
   The denatured alcohol it burns can be bought at almost any hardware store,
   and is much safer in an enclosed space than propane (not pressurized or silently leaking carbon monoxide). 

- [ ] $230 japanese butane, fuel is $9 per bottle.
   Designed for indoor use (in restaurants) as well as be taken outdoors for use.
   It's small and light. But fuel is expensive and difficult to find.

- [ ] $200 Beaver Tree kitchen in a <strong>portable</strong> plastic box with a
   cookstop, with room for utensils.
   http://domsoutdoor.com/beaver-tree-camp-kitchen-organizer/p/1-012886/

   Propane is widely available.

   Induction top take a lot of amps in battery power.

- [ ] Adjustable level for stove so pots sit evenly.
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8YUWQ8i-78&t=9m20s">*</a>

   ARRANGEMENT: An <strong>enclosure</strong> for fuel bottles that is sealed from passenger area, and
   have a drain for leaked gas going outide at the bottom. Put this near the back door,
   which is infrequently opened. Near the hinge of the door.

- [ ] ARRANGEMENT: Space to hang dish brush, sponge, and dish towels where they can air out.

- [ ] Microwave is a must-have for many at home, to cook frozen food.

- [ ] Toaster is a luxury item!

- [ ] Solar oven?


<a name="Refigerator"></a>

## Refigerator

IDEA: Consider freeze-dried foods that are light and requires no refrigeration.
   With that a <strong>hot water kettle</strong> is all you need.

Some need a fridge to keep their medicines cold.
A fridge helps to keep diary, fruits, and vegetables fresh.
A large fridge/freezer combo is necessary for longer trips.

- [ ] Some have a 3-way option to run off AC Power, DC Power, or LP Gas.
   RV models also automatically switch to run off LP Gas when there is no electricity.

   NOTE: Refrigerators in RVs are built to withstand the vibrations going down the road.

ARB 50qt Fridge Freezer. The portable fridges made today are light years beyond what you may find in a dingy RV made 10 or 15 years ago. The biggest improvement is that they consume a small fraction of electricity compared to their predecessors. 

   RV friges go from $1,100 to over $3000 for larger units.
   Contact RV dealers for closeouts and refurbished units.

   * Whynter Frige/freezer 110 or 12v

   * http://www.dometic.com/USA/

   * http://www.norcold.com/norcold/index.html

   PROTIP: A free-standing fridge has flexibility anywhere, including outside.

   ARRANGEMENT: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bRp1ErmtwM&t=1m45s">
   Have the fridge near the door, face outside for easy access</a>.

- [ ] Cooler between seats

   LOCATION: In Winters, wheel the fridge in to the cockpit area (passenger seat area)
   which isn't kept heated at night in the Winter.
   
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thetford.com/HOME/CUSTOMERSUPPORT/RefrigeratorConversionChart/tabid/261/Default.aspx">Fridge conversion chart</a>

   STRATEGY: Is an <strong>ice maker</strong> a deal-breaker or a non-essential for you?
   I prefer more spece to the freezer unit, so I use the room for frozen foods,
   and make ice rather than keep liquids cold.

   4.3-cubic feet, 

- [ ] Use a level when installing to keep the unit level.

- [ ] Adding a battery-operated RV refrigerator fan will not only decrease your cool down time by 50%, 
   it also help temperatures remain more consistent.  They run on two “D cell” batteries for 30 days or more. 
   A great money-saving option, for only $15.
   From http://blog.rvshare.com/rv-refrigerators/


   ### Ice/Freezer compartment

   Ahhh. Cold ice cream on a hot day.

   But it takes more energy to keep food frozen.
   Constant energy.

   This would need to be put away when the van is moving.


<a name="Electrical"></a>

## Electrical

- [ ] Paneltronics 

- [ ] Two 12V AGM Gel batteries.
   Needed to power heater, laptop, monitor, etc..

   LOCATION: Separate from gas tanks.

- [ ] Minn Kota charger 



<a name="Entertainment"></a>

### Entertainment

- [ ] iPad on the wall held up by brackets.

- [ ] Projection TV takes up ??? amps


### Lighting

- [ ] LED lighting (lower power). Battery powered ones don't drain main battery.

- [ ] plugs



### Solar panel

- [ ] A structure on the roof to walk, stand, sleep on.

   ARRANGEMENT: Space for storing smaller solar panels kept in the van so they don't get stolen.

- [ ] Boulder Panels from Goal Zero are that smaller size. 
   Each panel puts out 11, but they can be chained together.


<hr />

<a name="Water"></a>

## Water

We need fresh water to live. But water is heavy.

- [ ] Instead of big 20 gallon water tank, use <strong>separate blue water jugs</strong> 
  for better portability and easier refill.
   
   Smaller jugs are easier to clean inside, 
   and easily replaceable from WalMart.

   NOTE: There are separate colors for blue potable and gray water jugs.

<a name="Sink"></a>

### Sink for Dishes (and Clothes Laundry?)

Water is needed for dish washing.

   Magnetic hose holder</a> for a flat counter space

Hot water and Gray Water collector

- [ ] Potable water above the sink so it's gravity fed.

- [ ] Black tubes above the van to collect hot water?

- [ ] Instant hot water spigot from a unit under sink.

Not enough room for two sinks?

Clothes washing is something that is rare to see within van builds.

   If occassional stops to a laundry Mat is not for you:

   $48.95 portable washing machine and spin-drier</a>
   as a <strong>sink</strong>?

   It washes a few items at a time (5 lbs).

   STRATEGY: Have a larger sink.
   Sink from replaceable plastic tub instead of stainless steel

   ARRANGEMENT: Room for air drying clothes (and its humidity) also needs to be considered.

### Hot Shower

This is a key differentiator why one would get a larger van
(rather than sleeping in a car).

STRATEGY: Put the shower next to the door, so it can dry out by opening the door.
This also makes it easier to remove humidity via air dry by just opening the door.
This would entail having waterproof entryway, which we want anyway.
The shower curtain around the door makes for a "mud room" which keeps out drafts into the van. Brilliant.
It's an easy way to wash out what is the dirtest part of the floor.
Great for trips to the beach to get rid of sand on feet before entry.

- [ ] Long hose showerhead reach outside to hose things down
   (by the beach). Or for an outdoor shower.

- [ ] Curtain to keep out steam into the living space (which cause mildew).

-   STRATEGY: Put shoe storage near the door.

- [ ] Track in ceiling so a box can be moved around easily.
   The storage box that uses the room when no one's showering. 
   But it slides out during showers on a track to put the storage unit in the hallway.

OPTION: Webasto heats both the water and the air.
Installed only by certified installers.

uses diesel gas.

- [ ] A foot-pedal or motion-sensor switch to turn on and off water (like doctors have).

- [ ] 5 inch hole for shower basin connection to gray water tank.

- [ ] Gray water tank under floor, secured by 3/8" drill and tap.

- [ ] RV Valterra 3 inch valve mount.

- [ ] Heat wrap around gray water tank outside.



<a name="Toilet"></a>

## Toilet

CAUTION: Police point to fecal matter in the van as a health violation.

STRATEGY: In small vans forgo the toilet to recoup its space,
and use throw-away toilet boxes.

STRATEGY: Place the toilet near the bed for quicker access
(even though one can't go very far in a little van)?

Chemical toilets like the ones on airplanes smell.

   Anti-freeze in toilet.

- [ ] Composting toilet smell much less.

Or if you're at a place where there are bathrooms, 
wide-mouth bottles plus
a simple single-use toilet could be enough.

Water in toilet area, when hosed down, flow outside.

Maserator on the hose.

* Fridge is an Engel SR-70F-U1 (AC/DC) that has been running 24/7/365 for two years. 
* The awning is a Fiamma F35 Pro and the "tent" is their accessory "Privacy Room Lite" that attaches to the awning; not inexpensive but very stable and adds an enclosed patio to the truck.
