* [Manage Disk Space on MacOS](/mac-diskspace/)

This article describes how you can manage to minimize disk space usage.

## Why?

Disk space is expensive. If you can live with a 256 GB drive vs. a 500 GB drive, you save hundreds of dollars.

The more files on your laptop, the more you stand to lose and the longer it takes to restore your laptop when you (inevitably) have to recover it.

## Take Disk Inventory

Visualize the largest files using your disk space using the free GPL app
Disk Inventory X from http://www.derlien.com/
which presents the sizes of files and folders in graphical "treemaps". 


## Remove Unneeded Language

One quick and simple way of recovering more

brew monolingual at
https://ingmarstein.github.io/Monolingual/index.html

## GitHub

Delete your copy of repos on your local hard disk when you are not actively editing a particular repo.

## Cloud Disks

Apple iCloud, Box, Dropbox, Google Cloud, Amazon Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, etc.
