{% include _toc.html %}

This article describes how to use JHipster to generate a complete set
of code using the hippest (lastest, shinest) tools and utilities.

As I describe in my [article on code generation](/code-generation/), 
generation of programming code is not new, 
it's just become more useful, complete, and thus important over time.


## Background

The first commit to 
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jhipster/">
https://github.com/jhipster</a> 
(<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/java_hipster">@java_hipster</a>)
 by <a href="#JulienDubois">Julien Dubois</a>
was on October 21, 2013.

<a target="_blank" href="https://jhipster.github.io/">
JHipster.github.io</a> 
JHipster should really be called a <strong>project generator</strong>
   and not just a code generator because it generates ALL the code.
JHipster creates code for the entire application and DevOps stacks
based on entity data models defined in its
<a target="_blank" href="https://jhipster.github.io/jdl-studio/">
JDL Studio</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/kkHN2G_nXV0?t=1460">
See video</a>.

What is generated will not be exactly what you want, but it gets you going, making use of all the many components of the front-end, back-end, and DevOps tool stacks.


## Alternatives

0. View the JHipster product webpage (in 5 screenshots):

   <a target="_blank" href="https://jhipster.github.io/screenshots/">
   https://jhipster.github.io/screenshots/</a> 

   The website is based on source at<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster.github.io">
   https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster.github.io</a>

   My commentary while looking at each screen:

   #### Welcome Screen

   <a target="_blank" href="https://jhipster.github.io/images/screenshot_1.png"><img width="400" alt="jhipster_1-welcome-800x486.png" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/27997881-68b197d8-64be-11e7-874b-08511e29bdc1.png"><br /><small>(click image for full-screen image)</small></a>

   All this was generated.

   #### Monitoring

   <a target="_blank" href="https://jhipster.github.io/images/screenshot_2.png"><img width="400" alt="jhipster_2-monitoring-800x498.png" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/27997908-013d956a-64bf-11e7-8d0c-9e9453d3ae2c.png"><br /><small>(click image for full-screen image)</small></a>

   Installation of JVM monitoring agents is automatically done,
   as is the UI.


   #### Logging

   <a target="_blank" href="https://jhipster.github.io/images/screenshot_4.png"><img width="400" alt="jhipster_4-logmgmt-800x406.png" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/27997957-1574de5c-64c0-11e7-9d8e-97de29109292.png"><br /><small>(click image for full-screen image)</small></a>

   Many back-end services are automatically generated, 
   such as log management.


   #### Admin Forms

   <a target="_blank" href="https://jhipster.github.io/images/screenshot_3.png"><img width="400" alt="jhipster_3-form-260x342.png" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/27997981-de2903dc-64c0-11e7-8616-cb09edf94eb2.png"><br /><small>(click image for full-screen image)</small></a>

   The generator provides several choices for app UI:
   * Bootstrap for "responsive" CSS.
   * HTML5 Boilerplate to avoid inconsistencies among browsers.



   #### Entity Forms

   <a target="_blank" href="https://jhipster.github.io/images/screenshot_5.png"><img width="400" alt="jhipster_5-books-800x471.png" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/27998014-6376d0d2-64c1-11e7-8df6-d62221266afe.png"><br /><small>(click image for full-screen image)</small></a>

   In addition to the "Freelancer" UI theme, there are other skins 
   for Bootstrap at
   <a target="_blank" href="https://bootswatch.com/">
   bootswatch.com</a>.


   ### Advantages of this

   PROTIP: The fantastic thing about the app generated is that the
   technologies underneath are <strong>changeable</strong>.

   You can choose between any of the popular databases:
   MySQL, MongoDB, Cassanda, MSSQL, etc

   Today, it's SPA (Single Page Application) Angular UIs 
   with WebSockets communication to back-end Java Spring microservices.

   
   BTW, "AngularJs" refers to the Angular1.x framework at
   <a target="_blank" href="http://angularjs.blogspot.com/2016/12/ok-let-me-explain-its-going-to-be.html">AngularJS.org</a>

   #Angular covers the other versions at angular.org:

   * Angular 2 initially was not back-compatible until Typescript.
   * Angular 3 is skipped as a version number.
   * Angular 4 on 2017-03 (backward compatible with Angular 2)
   * Angular 5 on 2017-09
   * Angular 6 on 2018-03
   * Angular 7 on 2018-09
   <br /><br />

   All Google applications use Angular version equal to the current GitHub’s master branch of the Angular repository. 

   ReactJS is being worked on as 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/tree/jh-react"> branch jh-react</a>, moved from
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hipster-labs">
   https://github.com/hipster-labs</a>
   until it is added to the <a target="_blank" 
   href="https://jhipster.github.io/tech-stack/">
   JHipster technology stack</a>.


   ### Third-party Add-on modules

   <a target="_blank" href="https://jhipster.github.io/modules/marketplace/#/list"> A marketplace of third-party modules</a>
   (that act like standard JHipster sub-generators)
   can access JHipster variables and functions through hook mechanisms
   before and after <a target="_blank" href="http://yeoman.io/generators/">
   Yeoman app generation</a>:

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://jhipster.github.io/modules/marketplace/#/details/generator-jhipster-vuejs">
   Use VueJS</a> 
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://jhipster.github.io/modules/marketplace/#/details/generator-jhipster-google-analytics">

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://jhipster.github.io/modules/marketplace/#/details/generator-jhipster-google-maps">
   Google Maps</a>
   <br /><br />

   ### Still to do

   0. 2FA (Two-factor authentication).

   0. Static pages for fast loading, as with Jekyll?

   0. Shopping cart with Hazelcart + MySQL

   0. Google Maps of geolocation data

   0. Visualizations of app data (using D3.js or http://krispo.github.io/angular-nvd3)

   0. Automatic tuning of configuration parameters.

   0. Comparison of "total cost per app transaction" varying various components.

   0. Twillo and IFTTT integration to send SMS, make calls, etc.

   0. Business rules engine

   0. Ideas from others


   ### Microservice architecture

   JHipster generates a full fledge microservice architecture 
   that makes use of Netflix’s OSS (Open Source Software). From jhipster.github.io/microservices-architecture

   <a target="_blank" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/27989850-a1a1b65e-6400-11e7-9dec-371c9bb5d151.png">

   Visitors to the website use a modern browser such as Chrome or Firefox.

   In a Gateway server a Zuul Proxy 
   distributes traffic to AngularJS app servers.

   For Access Control apps reference a 
   JHipster UAA (???) server containing user role information.

   Apps reference 
   Ribbon
   which handles WebSocket calls to servers handling various microservices.

   Hashicorp Consul 
   
   JHipster Registry
   contains a Eureka server that ...
   and a Spring cloud Config server.
   These servers are provided by Netflix.
   They access Git repos.

   The JHipster Console consists of a Elasticsearch database fed by
   logs ingested by Logstash and displayed by Kibana.
   Administration of this ELK stack is accessed by a separate browser 
   instance on port 5601 by default. 
   Logs managed make use of default port 5000.

## Installation

   See https://jhipster.github.io/installation/

### Build dev environment

   See https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-devbox

0. Install Vagrant.
0. `vagrant up`

   <pre>
==>  Provider 'virtualbox' not found. We'll automatically install it now...
     The installation process will start below. Human interaction may be
     required at some points. If you're uncomfortable with automatically
     installing this provider, you can safely Ctrl-C this process and install
     it manually.
==>  Downloading VirtualBox 5.0.10...
     This may not be the latest version of VirtualBox, but it is a version
     that is known to work well. Over time, we'll update the version that
     is installed.
==>  Installing VirtualBox. This will take a few minutes...
     You may be asked for your administrator password during this time.
     If you're uncomfortable entering your password here, please install
     VirtualBox manually.
Password:
==>  VirtualBox has successfully been installed!
A Vagrant environment or target machine is required to run this
command. Run `vagrant init` to create a new Vagrant environment. Or,
get an ID of a target machine from `vagrant global-status` to run
this command on. A final option is to change to a directory with a
Vagrantfile and to try again.
   </pre> 

   Use of a vagrant image would not require these actions to setup a dev box:

   * Install Ubuntu 16.04 operating system.
   * Goggle Chrome and Firefox browsers
   * Install OpenJDK (Java Development Kit)

   * Install Ubuntu Make
   * Use Make to install IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
   * Install Gulp task runner (build tool) runs under Node/NPM.
   * Install Bower to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application.

   * pgAdmin 3
   * messaging system Apache Kafka? (not RabbitMQ as maintained by Pivotal)
   * MySQL Workbench
   * MongoDB client
   * Cassandra DB command line (command cqlsh)
   * Cloud Foundry command line (command cf)
   * Heroku toolbelt command line

0. Open a browser (Chrome) and go to local server:

   <a target="_blank" href="http://127.0.0.1:2222">
   127.0.0.1:2222</a>

   Do this quickly or you'll see:

   <pre>
Timed out while waiting for the machine to boot. This means that
Vagrant was unable to communicate with the guest machine within
the configured ("config.vm.boot_timeout" value) time period.
&nbsp;
If you look above, you should be able to see the error(s) that
Vagrant had when attempting to connect to the machine. These errors
are usually good hints as to what may be wrong.
&nbsp;
If you're using a custom box, make sure that networking is properly
working and you're able to connect to the machine. It is a common
problem that networking isn't setup properly in these boxes.
Verify that authentication configurations are also setup properly,
as well.
&nbsp;
If the box appears to be booting properly, you may want to increase
the timeout ("config.vm.boot_timeout") value.

   ### Install JHipster Design Language Studio

0. Install JHipster Studio within generators-jhipster/generators folder:

   <pre>yo jhipster:import-jdl jhipster-jdl.jh
   </pre>

   In future versions:

   <pre>jhipster import-jdl
   </pre>

   The response when I did it:

   <pre>
You don't seem to have a generator with the name “jhipster:import-jdl” installed.
But help is on the way:
&nbsp;
You can see available generators via npm search yeoman-generator or via http://yeoman.io/generators/. 
Install them with npm install generator-jhipster:import-jdl.
&nbsp;
To see all your installed generators run yo without any arguments. Adding the --help option will also show subgenerators. 
&nbsp;
If yo cannot find the generator, run yo doctor to troubleshoot your system.
   </pre>

0. Start the ???

   <pre>yarn start</pre>

   <pre>
yarn start v0.27.5
error Couldn't find a package.json file in "/Users/mac/gits/wilsonmar/jhipster-sample"
   </pre>

0. Yeoman front-end app generator:


   ### Maven pull

   Use the embedded Maven wrapper to run:

   <pre><strong>jhipster
   ./mvnw
   </strong></pre>

   The above installs based on the <strong>pom.xml</strong>:

0. Sass = "syntactically awesome style sheets"
0. WebSockets
0. Browsersync
0. Spring Data JPA generates JPA repositories automatically
0. Liquibase from http://www.datical.com/ - the ORM (Object Relation Model) that works with Spring and JPA (Java Persistance) to handle updating database schemas
0. Elasticsearch for JMX or Graphite reporting

0. https://webpack.github.io/ to squeeze only those JavaScript functions
   that are only used. Compiles, minifies, optimizes front-end for hot-reload.
0. Leaflet.js
0. http://www.thymeleaf.org/ template engine to generate Web pages server side
Replaces JSPs and JSTLs, which are outdated and deprecated

   <pre>&LT;h1 th:text="#{title}">Hello, world&LT;/h1></pre>

0. Netflix OSS

   JHipster Registry

   * Eureka - Service registry for load balancing and failover.
   * Zuul - Proxy for dynamic routing, monitoring and security
   * Ribbon - software load balancing for services

0. Caching

   * Ehcache is the most widely used solution
   * HazelCast is a great alternative, with clustering support!
   * Hibernate 2nd level cache or Spring Caching abstraction


   ### Eclipse

   Eclipse

0. Edit the .editorconfig file to specify indent_size, etc.

   ### Run Generator

   PROTIP: One of the great advantages of using a code generator is
   having different options to do a similar thing.
   
0. Create or Navigate to your app's folder.

   Unlike other Java app generators, Yeoman expects to be in the directory 
   where it creates your project rather than creating it for you.

0. Initiate generation:

   <pre><strong>yo jhipster
   </strong></pre>

   BTW, this same command is used to upgrade as well.

   The generator asks a series of questions (15 or so).

   QUESTION: Is there sample automation to answer questions?

   ? (1/16) Which *type* of application would you like to create?

   * Monolithic
   * Services ???

## Modifications

   ### Customize landing page

   Substitute JHipster logo with your own logo.

   ### PWA

   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/5880"> PWA (Progressive Web Apps)</a>
   so that content loads for off-line usage on Mobile + desktop 

   Done by un-commenting lines in webpack.common.js and in index.html.


   ### Material Design

   <pre>npm install -g generator-jhipster-bootstrap-material-design
   yo jhipster-bootstrap-material-design
   </pre>

   <pre>
? Do you want to install Bootstrap Material design? Yes
Composing JHipster configuration with module bootstrap-material-design
Reading the JHipster project configuration for your module
 conflict bower.json
? Overwrite bower.json? overwrite
  force bower.json
  create src/main/webapp/app/blocks/config/bootstrap-material.config.js
 conflict src/main/webapp/scss/main.scss
? Overwrite src/main/webapp/scss/main.scss? overwrite
  force src/main/webapp/scss/main.scss
 conflict src/main/webapp/content/css/main.css
? Overwrite src/main/webapp/content/css/main.css? overwrite
  force src/main/webapp/content/css/main.css
   </pre>

   PROTIP: The vendor.css is before all material-design stylesheets in your
index.html

   ### Add Entity

   <pre><strong>jhipster entity Foo</strong></pre>

   Coding to handle entities are generated from JDL code.

   JDL is the JHipster Domain Language processed within the JDL Studio.

   <pre><strong>https://github.com/jhipster/jdl-samples
   </strong></pre>

   A "One to Many" relationship would be generated as a list screen
   by JHipster, which creates all the JPA entities, DTOs, Spring Rest Controllers all the way through to the client side with Angular.
