This article provides a hands-on introduction on how to use JHipster (<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/java_hipster">@java_hipster</a>) to generate a complete set of code using the hippest (lastest, shinest) tools and utilities, running in a cloud of your choice.

[Generation of programming code](/code-generation/) is not new. It's just now become more useful, complete, and thus important. Traditionally, crafting everything by hand seemed more economical. Creating a generator is an investment that requires longer-term thinking. But many now realize that maintaining code, and upgrading components, require much more time than anticipated. The complexity of all the code needed require a <strong>community</strong> of developers work on integrations for everyone else. Everyone benefits from the work of each person, not just for a single app within a single company. This makes upgrades much easier than hacking them every time. This reduces "technical debt".


## Competitors

Wix.com charges money each month and provides limited options. JHipster is open-source, thus free and "hackable".

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.openhub.net/p/generator-jhipster">
   https://www.openhub.net/p/generator-jhipster</a><br />
   lists several competitors:

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://www.openhub.net/p/seedstack">
   SeedStack</a>


## Front-end UI

What is leading-edge about the UI is that generation is based on an <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model">"entity data model"</a> that talks about business-level objects, not technical entities. 

   <a target="_blank" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30143332-7b0da9f0-9342-11e7-99c6-b322481fe4a6.jpg"><img alt="jhipster-entity-572x562-98906" width="572" height="562" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30143332-7b0da9f0-9342-11e7-99c6-b322481fe4a6.jpg"></a>

This visual presentation is from the <a target="_blank" href="https://jhipster.github.io/jdl-studio/">JDL Studio</a> JHipster people created to build and manage models. (<a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/kkHN2G_nXV0?t=1460">
See video</a>) 

Add another entity and JHipster builds a form screen to manage the data:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://jhipster.github.io/images/screenshot_5.png"><img width="400" alt="jhipster_5-books-800x471.png" width="650" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/27998014-6376d0d2-64c1-11e7-8df6-d62221266afe.png"><br /><small>(click image for full-screen image)</small></a>

   Visitors to the website must use a modern browser such as Chrome or Firefox.

   The generator provides several choices for app UI.
   * Bootstrap for "responsive" CSS.
   * HTML5 Boilerplate to avoid inconsistencies among browsers.

   What is generated will probably not be exactly what you want visually. But in addition to the "Freelancer" UI theme, there are other skins for Bootstrap at
   <a target="_blank" href="https://bootswatch.com/">
   bootswatch.com</a> and other sites.

   The UI is a SPA (Single Page Application) that communicate via HTTP/2 WebSockets to back-end Java Spring microservices. BTW, "AngularJs" refers to the Angular1.x framework at
   <a target="_blank" href="http://angularjs.blogspot.com/2016/12/ok-let-me-explain-its-going-to-be.html">AngularJS.org</a>. Plain "Angular" refers to a current version (at angular.org):

   * Angular 2 initially was not back-compatible until Typescript.
   * Angular 3 is skipped as a version number.
   * Angular 4 on 2017-03 (backward compatible with Angular 2)
   * Angular 5 on 2017-09
   * Angular 6 on 2018-03
   * Angular 7 on 2018-09
   <br /><br />

   NOTE: ReactJS is being worked on as 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/tree/jh-react"> branch jh-react</a>, moved from
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hipster-labs">
   https://github.com/hipster-labs</a>
   until it is added to the <a target="_blank" 
   href="https://jhipster.github.io/tech-stack/">
   JHipster technology stack</a>.

### Registration

But it gets you started with a website that has, for one, a full-featured user registration screen:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/28052845-7ca3bbb0-65ca-11e7-9479-1c145ec883b6.png">
   <img alt="jhipster-21points-616x972-36kb.png" width="400" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/28052845-7ca3bbb0-65ca-11e7-9479-1c145ec883b6.png"><br /><small>(click image for full-screen image)</small></a>

<a name="AdminMenu"></a>

### Admin functionality

Also generated is a default implementation of back-end and DevOps code that automatically scales in a cloud.

   <img alt="jhipster-great-admin-menu-335x446-19k" width="200" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/29252305-60fbf382-8032-11e7-8bc3-e86ae276d96b.png">

Installation of JVM monitoring agents is automatically done, with this UI:

   JHipster also generates load testing code for Gatling to run.

## From Specs to Prod

JHipster should really be called a <strong>project generator</strong> (and not just a code generator) because it creates code for the entire application project and also the whole <strong>DevOps stack</strong>:

The stages to generating an application using JHipster:

1. Use the JHipster generator to create a base set of files based on unique configuration settings. 
2. Download the various node module libraries. 
3. Run the web server.

Let's do the first stage first.


## Generate Custom App Code

The JHipster generator is housed in GitHub at<br />
<a target="_blank" href="https://gitter.im/jhipster/generator-jhipster">
<strong>https://gitter.im/jhipster/generator-jhipster</strong></a>

Through collaboration by <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/">nearly 400 contributors on GitHub</a>, the JHipster generator is reaching fruition. The first commit to the repo
was by <a href="#JulienDubois">Julien Dubois</a> on October 21, 2013.

There are two options to make use of it:

   ![jhipster-base-repo-650x262-116385](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30228559-95337198-949b-11e7-8aaa-53ea48d409d5.jpg)

A) Clone or download it into your local folder and run its command line program to create application code based on specifications. 

B) Use a JHipster cloud website that provides a form to select specifications which the website uses to create the application. We're doing this first:

0. Go to https://github.com/login and Login.
0. Click "+" to create a new public repo. I call it "JHipster-app1".
0. In a web browser, go to <a target="_blank" href="https://start.jhipster.tech/#/">
   JHipster Online at https://start.jhipster.tech</a> and Register.
0. In the email, click link to Activate. Sign-in on JHipster Online.
0. Authorize "JHipster by jhipster" to access your GitHub account.

   NOTE: Revoke app access at https://github.com/settings/applications

0. Create/Generate app at https://start.jhipster.tech/#/generate-application
   
   ![jhipster-cloud-config1-650x440-104505](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30233655-26785e26-94b4-11e7-9cb0-a7bf91be2de3.jpg)

0. Scroll down to use all default selections and click "Generate on GitHub".

   "jhipsterSampleApplication"

0. Righ-click on the link, such as https://github.com/wilsonmar/jhipsterSampleApplication
0. Click Close.

0. In a Terminal, create or navigate to a folder where this command creates a folder, such as a folder containing your account name.

   <tt><strong>git clone https://github.com/wilsonmar/jhipsterSampleApplication.git
   </strong></tt>

   NOTE: At the time of writing, the download consists of 1,128,887 bytes (2.1 MB on disk) for 398 items.

##  Build App Code

   Now that app custom code is available (from either of the two methods above) ...

   ### Install Node

0. Use these instructions for Windows and Mac/Linux.

   ### Install Yarn package manager used by JHipster

   JHipster is about using the "hippest" (latest "shiny object"). By that I mean it enables uses of alternative tools becuase it integrates the alternative automatically when it generates app and DevOps code.

   For starters, instead of NPM (Node Package Manager) that comes with Node, JHipster uses its faster and more "reliable" alternative <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn">yarn</a>,
   which was released in <a target="_blank" href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/1840075619545360">October 2016 by Facebook</a> (in collaboration with Exponent, Google, and Tilde). Its <a target="_blank" href="https://registry.yarnpkg.com">https://registry.yarnpkg.com</a> goes to the https://www.cloudflare.com/ CDN.

0. Although yarn can be installed using NPM, that's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/node-js/yarn-a-package-manager-for-node-js">not recommended</a>. 
   
   On Windows, <a target="_blank" href="https://yarnpkg.com/latest.msi">Download the msi installer file</a>. On 

   On MacOS or Unix, use a curl command:

   <tt><strong>curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash
   </strong></tt>

   ### Yarn install

0. Use yarn to create a <strong>node_modules</strong> folder and populate it based on specifications in the project's <strong>package.json</strong> file:

   <tt><strong>yarn install
   </strong></tt>

   In the response are:

   <pre>info No lockfile found.
   ...
   success Saved lockfile.
   </pre>

   NOTE: Yarn automatically creates a <strong>yarn.lock</strong> file saved with other assets in the repo. The file ensures that the same version of every single file and the exact same file structure of the node_modules directory is the same across all machines. By contrast, NPM's `npm-shrinkwrap.json` is generated manually by the `npm shrinkwrap` command. 

   Afterward, note the folder has grown to 284,269,020 bytes (409.9 MB on disk) for 45,877 items.


   ### .gitignore

0. The <strong>.gitignore</strong> file lists folders that yarn just created so that they don't get uploaded to GitHub.

   `/target/www/**` contains assets used by the web server.


   ### Tests

0. `/target/test-results` is re-created when tests are run using the PhantomJS "headless" browser.

   <tt><strong>yarn test
   </strong></tt>

   A sample response of the coverage:

   <pre>
=============================== Coverage summary ===============================
Statements   : 65.47% ( 622/950 )
Branches     : 32.43% ( 72/222 )
Functions    : 44% ( 99/225 )
Lines        : 63.28% ( 536/847 )
================================================================================
Done in 20.62s.
   </pre>

0. Launch the application's tests:

   <tt><strong>./mvnw clean test
   </strong></tt>

   The response concludes with something like this:

   <pre>
Tests run: 118, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0

   ### BrowserSync

   The UI at port 3001 is for the BrowserSync server, which automatically performs a page reload (like pressing Ctrl+R) when it detects a change to code. Detection occurs by it being setup as a proxy between the browser client and server. It then injects a javascript file on every page in order to make use of WebSockets to communicate between the server and the client to watch changes to your code or browser action. See browsersync.io.

## DevOps Back-end

   <a target="_blank" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/27989850-a1a1b65e-6400-11e7-9dec-371c9bb5d151.png">

   The "J" in JHipster refers to the Java programming language coded with Spring Boot <a target="_blak" href="https://jhipster.github.io/microservices-architecture">"microservice architecture"</a> that runs <a target="_blank" href="#NetflixOSS">Netflix’s OSS (Open Source Software)</a> with Docker containers.

   In a Gateway server, Zuul Proxy software
   distributes traffic to AngularJS app servers.

   For Access Control apps reference a 
   JHipster UAA (???) server containing user role information.

   Apps reference 
   Ribbon
   which handles WebSocket calls to servers handling various microservices.

   Hashicorp Consul 
   
   JHipster Registry
   contains a Eureka server that ...
   and a Spring cloud Config server.
   These servers are provided by Netflix.
   They access Git repos.

   The JHipster Console consists of a Elasticsearch database fed by
   logs ingested by Logstash and displayed by Kibana.
   Administration of this ELK stack is accessed by a separate browser 
   instance on port 5601 by default. 
   Logs managed make use of default port 5000.

   `GreatBigExampleApplicationApp.java` is the code providing the entry point.

   `ApplicationWebXml.java` is used for logging, referencing folder<br />
   `aop` (Aspect Oriented Programming).

   `security` holds the jwt and social sign-in code.

   `config` holds sub-classes for audit, social, etc.

   `domain` holds classes corresponding to the Entities in the UI.

   `repository` holds classes defining the persistant layer (database).

   `service` holds utility code used by services.

   `web` holds web and websocket network resource code.

   These use a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Data_transfer_object">
   DTO (Data Transfer Object)</a> that reduces the number of round-trip calls by aggregating several calls into one call only. DTOs do not have behavior except for remote storage and retrieval of its own data (mutators and accessors), so they don't require testing.


   #### Java testing source

0. Let's dive into the Java test code directories:

   <tt><strong>cd src/test

     The installation process will start below. Human interaction may be
     required at some points. If you're uncomfortable with automatically
     installing this provider, you can safely Ctrl-C this process and install
     it manually.
==>  Downloading VirtualBox 5.0.10...
     This may not be the latest version of VirtualBox, but it is a version
     that is known to work well. Over time, we'll update the version that
     is installed.
==>  Installing VirtualBox. This will take a few minutes...
     You may be asked for your administrator password during this time.
     If you're uncomfortable entering your password here, please install
     VirtualBox manually.

==>  VirtualBox has successfully been installed!
A Vagrant environment or target machine is required to run this
command. Run `vagrant init` to create a new Vagrant environment. Or,
get an ID of a target machine from `vagrant global-status` to run
this command on. A final option is to change to a directory with a
Vagrantfile and to try again.
   </pre> 

   Use of a vagrant image would not require these actions to setup a dev box:

   <a target="_blank" href="http://127.0.0.1:2222">
   127.0.0.1:2222</a>

   Do this quickly or you'll see:

   <pre>
Timed out while waiting for the machine to boot. This means that
Vagrant was unable to communicate with the guest machine within
the configured ("config.vm.boot_timeout" value) time period.
&nbsp;
If you look above, you should be able to see the error(s) that
Vagrant had when attempting to connect to the machine. These errors
are usually good hints as to what may be wrong.
&nbsp;
If you're using a custom box, make sure that networking is properly
working and you're able to connect to the machine. It is a common
problem that networking isn't setup properly in these boxes.
Verify that authentication configurations are also setup properly,
as well.
&nbsp;
If the box appears to be booting properly, you may want to increase
the timeout ("config.vm.boot_timeout") value.

   ### Run Generator

   PROTIP: One of the great advantages of using a code generator is
   having different options to do a similar thing.
   
0. Create or Navigate to your app's folder.

   Unlike other Java app generators, Yeoman expects to be in the directory 
   where it creates your project rather than creating it for you.

0. Initiate generation:

   <pre><strong>yo jhipster
   </strong></pre>

   BTW, this same command is used to upgrade as well.

   The generator asks a series of questions (15 or so).

   QUESTION: Is there sample automation to answer questions?

   ? (1/16) Which *type* of application would you like to create?

   * Monolithic
   * Services ???


   <a name="SubGenerators"></a>

   ### Sub-generators

   "import-jdl" sub-generator generates a complex entity model using JDL Studio

   "entity" sub-generator generates a complete JPA entity, from database to Angular

   JDL is the JHipster Domain Language processed within the JDL Studio.

   <pre><strong>https://github.com/jhipster/jdl-samples
   </strong></pre>

   A "One to Many" relationship would be generated as a list screen
   by JHipster, which creates all the JPA entities, DTOs, Spring Rest Controllers all the way through to the client side with Angular.

   shows how to build a microservices architecture with JHipster 4.5.4. Generate a gateway (powered by Netflix Zuul and the JHipster Gateway), a microservice (that talks to MongoDB), and use Docker Compose to make sure it all runs locally. Then deploy it to Minikube and Google Cloud using Kubernetes.

## Netflix OSS

Netflix OSS (<a target="_blank" href="https://netflix.github.io/">netflix.github.io</a>)
is a set of frameworks and libraries that Netflix wrote to solve some interesting distributed-systems problems at scale. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://blog.christianposta.com/microservices/netflix-oss-or-kubernetes-how-about-both/">
NOTE</a>: In addition to AWS cloud, Netflix OSS can run on Docker with Kubernetes, which comes with lots of “distributed-systems features” out of the box.
<a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/zerotodocker-an-easy-way-to-evaluate-netflixoss-through-runtime-packaging-845db21cb60b">"Zero to docker"</a> images on http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cnetflix
allows anyone with a Docker host (on their laptop, on a VM in the cloud, etc.) to, with a single command, run a single node of any NetflixOSS technology.

Netflix OSS can be used w/out Spring Cloud.
