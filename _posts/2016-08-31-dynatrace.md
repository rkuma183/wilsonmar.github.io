STATUS: IN PROGRESS

What's different with this introduction to Dynatrace is I provide a 
step-by-step hands-on approach to dive deep into the technology and its vendor.
This is so you're not stumbling around wasting time on high-level sales pitches.
Commentaries here are given "just-in-time" after you do each step.


## Acronyms used here

   ADK = Application Development Kit

   APM = Application Performance Monitoring (the market Dynatrace is in)

   AppMon = Application Performance

   SLA = Service Level Agreements

   Visit = a group of transactions performed by the same user over a defined time period.

   UEM = User Experience Management (product offering)

PureModel = PurePath + PureStack

   * PurePath monitors horizontally across the server tiers

   * PureStack dives into the vertical infrastructure

## Product Editions

There are different editions of Dynatrace for the Development Team, Test Center, and Production:

<a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/23922979/11b6313a-08db-11e7-9376-a6627907b058.png">

The product that enables "Shift-Left" is one that enables identification of performance issues
during development.

Competitors to Dynatrace include AppDynamics.

QUESTION: Does Dynatrace compete with OverOps, which analyzes Java and .NET source code.

0. If you want to do it the hard way and install locally, 
   click the operating system icon to download installer.

   | OS | File | Ver. | Size |

   | Windows | dynatrace- | 6.5 | 995.8 MB |

   PROTIP: If you want to keep installers, find out the version and add it to the file name.
   You would need to keep installers for vetting by corporate Security.

   Security-conscious enterprises have their people download from
   a vetted repository such as an internal Artifactory or Nexus rather than direct download
   because changes by the vendor (or someone pretending to be them) can have security problems.

0. Use Mac Archiver utility to extract the jar file to file dynatrace-full-darwin-x86.jar.cpgz.
0. dynatrace-full-darwin-x86.jar.cpgz.


## Provisioning

Overprovisioned?


### Troubled sample apps


Source code to programs that exhibit:

### memory leaks

### CPU hotspots

### n+1 problem 

The n+1 problem is when regression test finds client makes many more API calls to server.

## In AWS #

You can use Dynatrace in place of or in addition to Amazon CloudWatch logging.
Here are the steps:

0. Download the installer from Dynatrace.com.

   BLAH: I wish Dynatrace have its own on S3.

   This can be either/both a Windows or Linux instance.

0. Put the Dynatrace installer in an S3 instance
   so that Ansible scripts to build up a server have a stable reference.

0. Create a new AWS instance.

   Again, this can be either a Windows or Linux instance.

0. Install the Dynatrace agent on the server.

0. Connect the agents to the Dynatrace controller so you see metrics being recorded.

0. Impose some artificial load on the machine to see metrics in their full glory.

0. Repeat the above in an automated script:

   0. Jankins invoked when a commit occurs to a branch on GitHub
   0. The Jenkins v2 Pipeline Groovy script downloads build script from GitHub
   0. The build downloads installers to assemble
   0. The build script creates image in DockerHub
   0. Instantiate AWS with Docker image
   0. Sends an email when the image is ready for use
   0. Start a performance testing run
   0. Sends SMS texts with the results of test run
   0. If all is well, commits into the next branch in GitHub
