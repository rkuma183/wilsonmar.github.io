## Leading Companies #

Major organizations are in an arms race in offering 
Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning (ML) services in their clouds:

   * [Microsoft Cortana in Azure cloud](/microsoft-ai)
   * Facebook
   * Google
   * IBM Watson
   * Amazon Alexa
   <br />

Each of the above are cloud vendors hoping to cash in by charging for processing of other people's data.

Benedict Evans, the resident futurist at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, 
observes in a <a target="_blank" href="http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2016/6/23/ai-apple-and-google">
recent blog post</a> that the future of AI remains opaque: 
"This field is moving so fast that it's not easy to say where the strongest leads necessarily are, nor to work out which things will be commodities and which will be strong points of difference,"


## Other companies

<a target="_blank" href="https://algorithmia.com/algorithms">
Algorithmia.com</a> provide API interfaces to algorithms offered by its partners.


<a target="_blank" href="https://gibhut.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning/">
awesome-machine-learning</a>
provides many links to resources, so they will not be repeated here.


## Arxiv

## Data Conversions

   Some utilities may involve conventional lookups of data:

   * https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/Geo/ZipData

   * https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/Geo/ZipToState

   * https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/Geo/LatLongDistance

   * https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/Geo/LatLongToUTM

   * https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/util/ip2hostname

   * https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/opencv/ChangeImageFormat (from jpg to png)


<a name="Translation"></a>

## Translation #

   * Google Translate API 
   has been working on websites for years.


<a name="CV"></a>

## Image Recognition / Computer Vision #

   * https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/z/ColorPalettefromImage

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/">Google Cloud Vision API</a>

   * https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/opencv/FaceDetection
  then https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/opencv/CensorFace

   * https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/ocr/RecognizeCharacters OCR

   Some of these make use of <strong>OpenCV</strong> (CV = Computer Vision).


<a name="VoiceRecognition"></a>

## Voice Recognition

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/speech/">
   Google Cloud Speech API</a>, which powers Googleâ€™s own voice search and voice-enabled apps. 

   * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/microsofts-ai-can-now-understand-speech-better-than-humans/">
   Microsoft says its Cortana is as accurate as human transcriptionists</a>


## NLP Sentiment Analysis #

   Analyze text for positive or negative sentiment (opinion),
   based on a training database of potential word meanings,
   which involved Natural Language Processing:

   * https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/nlp/SentimentAnalysis

   * IBM's algorithm

   Andrew W. Trask,
   PhD student at University of Oxford
   Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing
   authored Grokking Deep Learning.

   Use Bag of words and
   Word2vec
   transform words into vectors.
   Use TFLearn, a Python library for quickly building networks.

## Document (article) Search #

   <strong>TF-IDF = Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency</strong>
   emphasizes important words (called a vector)
   which appear rarely in the corpus searched (rare globally).
   which appear frequently in document (common locally)
   Term frequency is measured by word count (how many occurances of each word).

   The IDF to downweight words is the log of #docs divided by 1 + #docs using given word.

   Cosine similarity normalizes vectors
   so small angle thetas identify similarity.

   Normalizing makes the comparison invariant to the number of words.
   The common compromise is to cap maximum word count.

## Footnotes

Python 3.6 has formatted strings


## Conda

Conda is similar to virtualenv and pyenv, other popular environment managers.

   https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/

   https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv

https://www.continuum.io/downloads

   conda install numpy pandas matplotlib

   conda install jupyter notebook

0. List the packages installed, with its version number and
   what version of Python:

   conda list



### Conda Environments

0. Create new environment for Python, specifying packages needed:

   conda create -n my_env python=3 numpy pandas

0. Enter an environment on Mac:

   source activate my_env

   On Windows:

   activate my_env

   When you're in the environment, the environment's name 
   appears in the prompt:

   (my_env) ~ $. 

0. Leave the environment

   source deactivate 

   On Windows, it's just deactivate.

0. Get back in again.

0. Create an enviornment file by piping the output from an export:

   conda env export > some_env.yaml

   When sharing your code on GitHub, it's good practice to make an environment file and include it in the repository. This will make it easier for people to install all the dependencies for your code. I also usually include a pip requirements.txt file using pip freeze (learn more here) for people not using conda.

0. Load an environment metadata file:

   conda env create -f some_env.yaml

0. List environments created on your machine:

   conda env list

0. Remove an environment:

   conda env remove -n some_env
