   * "Alexa, I would like to book a hotel"
   * "Alexa, I would like to pick up flowers"
   * "Alexa, I would like to order a ride"
   * "Alexa, I would like to see a dentist"

### Console

0. Lex Console

   ### AI Services

   Alternately, from 
   among a list of all Amazon's services, Lex is within AI services:
   <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai/">
   https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai</a>

   ### Add Some Personality

   IDEA: I'd like to put in some <strong>personality</strong>, like I'm having a conversation with a comic:

   * An <strong>encouraging</strong> response like a grandma.
   * Insults from Don Rickles or Sheakespeare or Mark Twain.
   * Self-Deprecating humor like Rodney Dangerfield.
   * Funny Observerations like from Jerry Seinfeld or Sarah Silverman or other comics.

   Adjustment of tone in voice would enable:

   * Sexual inuendos like from Mae West.
   * A British (butler) accent with <strong>sarcasm</strong> as I'm doing a banking task.
   * Dead-pan like that "Bueller" guy.


## In Settings:

### Slots - Usage

   Slots are input data.

   Amazon provides a City slot that has the world's major cities. 

   Lex remembers the user's context (what occurred before
   and user's perferences).


### Voices

   The initial release of Lex are in English US voices, a subset of voices from 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/polly/">
   Amazon Polly</a> is a Text-to-Speech (TTS) cloud service that converts text into lifelike speech.

   https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/polly-text-to-speech-in-47-voices-and-24-languages/

   Female:

   * Joanna sounds the most natural to me.
   * Salli
   * Kimberly has a bit of a raspy voice
   * Kendra is a deeper voice, the most "athoratative" to me.
   * Ivy sounds like a girl (about 10 years old is my guess)

   Male:

   * Justin sounds like a young boy
   * Joey 

   IDEA: Having a child voice can enhance a bot to help shopping for children.
