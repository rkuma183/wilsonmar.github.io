Kibana presents visualizations in a dashboard containing data from Elasticsearch databases.

Kibana was first built using Ruby with the Sinatra framework.

WARNING: Kibana 4 has a completely different approach to creating charts than Kibana 3.

<a name="KibanaConfig"></a>

##  Kibana Configuration

Kibana installs with its own Node.js server. It doesn't use a web server.

A default <strong>config.js</strong> comes with the installer.

A single node is a master, data, and client nodes.
A node specializes into data and client nodes.

   
   ### Edit configuration

0. Navigate into folder `/etc/kibana` to edit file `configuration.yml`.

0. For the `server.host:` settting, replace `localhost` with `192.168.0.16` or whatever it should be.

0. For the `server.name:` settting, replace `your-hostname` with your name.

0. For the `elasticsearch.url:` settting, replace `http://localhost:9200` with the IP and port defined.

0. Save the file.

0. Start the server:

   <tt><strong>service kibana start
   </strong></tt>

0. View the landing page at Kibana's default port 5601:

   <tt><strong>http://192.168.0.15:5601
   </strong></tt>

   The default "index patterns" screen should appear.

## Panel Types

Kibana is described as "general purpose" because it provides a rich pallette of visualizations it can display.

ELK stack became popular among server admins analyzing server logs.

  * bettermap (version 4 on)
  * column
  * goal
  * histogram
  * hits
  * map
  * sparklines
  * terms
  * text
  * trends

For example, Kibana can create a dashboard with these panes:

1) a heatmap to display Logstash-enhanced GeoIp data based on idgeo lookup

2) a line graph to display how many log hits (the higher a point, the more hits).

3) a pie chart to summarize the percentage of different error log levels.
