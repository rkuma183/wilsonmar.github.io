This is a hands-on narrated tour on how to end up with a serverless app running
in a server cloud.

<hr />

The sentiment about servers is reflected in the wi-fi password
attendees of #ServelessConf type in:<br />

## Serverless = FaaS

"Serverless" refer to an architectural style called
<strong>FaaS</strong> (Function as a Service) where programming 
code are independently deployed and run on a cloud system rather than on-premises servers.
The developer simply uploads the source code, 
then leave it to pros at the cloud provider to take care of 
security, monitoring, disk space management, log management, 
scaling, redundancy, backup, crash reporting, etc..

Zero system administration by the developer.

It's a fast route to get apps in production.

PROTIP: It's still up to developers to do testing and 
performance measuring and tuning.
Use of multi-tenancy makes for response-time variation.
So do sythentic transactions outside the cloud vendor to monitor user experience,
and to keep your app in cache to avoid process start-up after sleeping.

Mike Roberts at <a target="_blank" href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html">
   http://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html</a>
wrote
   "Depending on the circumstances, such systems can significantly reduce operational cost and complexity at a cost of <strong>vendor dependencies</strong> and (at the moment) immaturity of supporting services."


#### Database idle costs money! #

   "You never pay for idle" Austen says 
   in an interview with by CloudAcademy <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvmx0IVfBLc">
   Introduction to the Serverless Paradigm</a> [23:50]

   PROTIP: But this is not true within AWS if you use DynamoDB, which Amazon touts as the default database.
   While Lambda does not incur charges while idle,
   a DynamoDB incurs charges for data stored even though no data is read or written to it.

   PROTIP: On AWS use SimpleDB instead of DynamoDB for true no-cost idle.


## FaaS Providers

There is plenty of competition to keep prices low.

PROTIP: The future of FaaS vendors isn't the front-end but the back-end services
that include API Gateways and 
Artificial Intelligence features such as image recognition,
text sentiment analysis, natural language process (NLP), 
and Machine Learning.

### AWS Lambda

The AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) at
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model">
https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model</a>
was announced Nov 2016
to define the SAM format
to build <strong>Cloud Formation templates</strong> to access Amazon API Gateway APIs, AWS Lambda functions, and Amazon DynamoDB tables needed by serverless applications. 

Two AWS evangelists created <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-developer-workshop/blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS.md">pre-built templates</a> 
with manual instructions, which they walked though in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/events/PgC70I4pQoy14TP-RNS6Dw">30 minutes on Twitch.tv</a>:

1. [Get an AWS IAM User](/aws-iam/) with AWSCodeStarFullAccess.
2. Login the AWS Console to select region N. Virginia.
3. In <strong>AWS CodeStar</strong>. Start a project. Node.js. create role.
4. Choose a project template: 
   * Under Application Category select <strong>Web Application</strong>.
   * Under Programming Languages select <strong>Node.js</strong>.
   * Pick "Node.JS Web Application AWS Lambda (running serverless)".

### Azure Functions

Marketing information is at
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/" target="_blank">
https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions</a>

1. Create an Azure Storage account.
0. Search for "Function App" in the Azure Marketplace.
0. Click Create.
0. Provide an app name that's globally unique among all others public.

   .azurewebsites.net

0. Create or use a <strong>Resource Group</strong> to manage your similar functions as a group.
0. Select a Location closest to you.

   PROTIP: Include the location as a suffix in your app name.

0. Selection of Memory Allocation can be adjusted once you figure out how much after running
   a few times.
0. Create.
0. Click Refresh or the "bell" icon to see messages related.

0. After deployment, click the Resource Group, then the app name.
0. Click "Webhood + API" and JavaScript language (or C#).
0. Copy the Function URL and paste it in a browser.
0. Click Logs to see the history tracking.
0. Add a Parameter.

### IBM Bluemix OpenWhisk

<a target="_blank" href="https://developer.ibm.com/openwhisk/">
https://developer.ibm.com/openwhisk</a>

The advantage of IBM's hybrid-cloud approach is that one can use 
IBM's proprietary Bluemix UI
and then use command-line with OpenWhisk (which is open sourced).

<a name="Concerns"></a>

## Concerns

The other side of freedom from server hassles is that developers also give away
<strong>control</strong>.

Having one's data in another company's cloud requires trust in that company's
ability to keep data secure, redundant, etc.

PROTIP: Going with a particular vendor's API means that you need to keep up
with changes in APIs that can occur frequently,
even though they may not apply to your own operation.

There is the danger vendor lock-in.
But luckily, there is a way to alieviate that:

<a name="FrameworkStructure"></a>

## Structure of Folders and Files #

PROTIP: The serverless framework save developers' time by standardizing the structure of folders and files.

   <pre>
s-project.json       // Project file (JSON or YAML)
s-resources-cf.json  // CloudFormation template
s-templates.json     // Config templates and variables
admin.env            // AWS Profiles (gitignored)
_meta                // Metadata (gitignored)
function1            // A custom function
  |__event.json
  |__handler.js
  |__s-function.json
   </pre>

This set of project file is what developers work with.

The serverless framework programming which read and process project files
is written in Node JavaScript.

The <strong>s-project.json</strong> lists plugins:

   <pre>
{
  "name": "notes",
  "custom": {},
  "plugins": [
    "serverless-client-s3"
  ]
}
   </pre>

A key differentiator with the Serverless Framework is that infrastructure specs are defined as code in one project.
<strong>s-resources-cf.json</strong> is a AWS CloudFormation template
specifying security (IAM) roles, SNS email topics, DynamoDB tables, Queues, ARNs.

Components are deployed per stage (dev, prod, etc.),
allowing developers to easily deploy separate prod, test and dev environments.

Within the folder for each function is a <strong>s-function.json</strong>
file containing metadata such as <a href="#Plugins">plugins</a> installed with the project.

When the framework is created for a project, a <strong>.gitignore</strong> file is created with other files
to specify private and temporary work files that should not be publicly uploaded to GitHub.

Project metadata in file
<strong>_meta</strong> outputs and user variables used in function configurations.
But due to the sensitive nature of these variables, the file needs to be gitignore'd by default.
A workaround is to use the
Serverless Meta Sync plugin
which stores project metadata in S3.

<strong>admin.env</strong>


## Serverless Command-line #

Lambda functions can be defined from a command-line using the Serverless framework.

AWS May 2016 Webinar Series - Deep Dive on Serverless Web Applications
   <amp-youtube data-videoid="fXZzVzptkeo" layout="responsive" width="480" height="270"></amp-youtube>

http://abalone0204.github.io/2016/05/22/serverless-simple-crud/


## Keeping Secrets #

BLAH: AWS Lambda doesn't allow setting and reference to operating system <strong>environment variables</strong>.

Lambda functions have a
<strong>deploy.env</strong> file in combination with the
<strong>`--configFile`</strong> flag to set values which will be
prepended to your compiled Lambda function as
<strong>process.env</strong> environment variables before it gets uploaded to S3.

Secrets such as DB connection string or encryption key
are secure values that should not be checked into version control (specified in a .gitignore file).


<a name="LocalTesting"></a>

## Local Runs for testing #

For a "test-first" approach to achieve code maturity,
doing test runs locally before committing to a team branch is important.

Let's examine the choices to emulate AWS Lambda locally:

* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/local-node-lambda">
   local-node-lambda</a>

* <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ashiina/lambda-local">
   ashiina/lambda-local</a>

0. Install the "Command line tool for <strong>locally running</strong>
   and remotely deploying your node.js applications to Amazon Lambda."
   from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/motdotla/node-lambda">
   github.com/motdotla/node-lambda</a>

   <tt><strong>
   npm install -g <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-lambda">
   node-lambda</a>
   </strong></tt>

0. Describe tests in a JSON file.



<a name="Plugins"></a>

## Plugins #

The heart of Serverless are its Plugins.
Several plugins come with the Framework.

PROTIP: Plugins need to be installed for each project that uses each.

0. List plugins installed.

   <tt><strong>
   ls _meta/
   </strong></tt>

0. Navigate your active directory to the root of your project.
0. Plugins are downloaded from GitHub by npm:

* [serverless/serverless-meta-sync](https://github.com/serverless/serverless-meta-sync) - Securely sync your the variables in your project's `_meta/variables` across your team.

     <tt><strong>
     npm install serverless-offline --save
     </strong></tt>

* [dherault/serverless-offline](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline) - Emulate AWS Lambda and Api Gateway locally to speed up your development cycles.

* [kennu/serverless-plugin-hookscripts](https://github.com/kennu/serverless-plugin-hookscripts) - Easily create shell script hooks that are run whenever Serverless actions are executed.
