{% include _toc.html %}

This article provides a hands-on introduction to generate an application (with tests) using the hippest (lastest, most productive) tools for front-end, back-end, and DevOps tooling, running first locally, then publically in a scalable cloud.

![jhipster-stacks 493x331-66591](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30333179-951cd392-9799-11e7-955c-7d5ee3a334ef.jpg)

[Generation of programming code](/code-generation/) is not new. It's just now become more useful, complete, and thus important. Traditionally, crafting everything by hand seemed more economical. Creating a generator was an extra investment that requires longer-term thinking and some mental gymnastics. 

But many now realize that maintaining <strong>interfaces</strong> between the many app and DevOps components that seems to need constant upgrading require much more time than anticipated. The complexity of all the code needed require a <strong>community</strong> of developers work on integrations for everyone else. Everyone benefits from the work of each person, not just for a single app within a single company. This makes upgrades much easier than hacking them every time. This reduces "technical debt" that cause delays and force errors.

## Generate code using JHipster

<a target="_blank" href="https://jhipster.tech">https://jhipster.tech</a> is the home page for JHipster. It is based on source at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster.github.io">
   https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster.github.io</a>

   <a target="_blank" title="jhipster-tech-1419x748.png" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30241644-a9152e82-9544-11e7-9bac-d7fc923d8868.jpg"><img alt="jhipster-tech-650x343-85002.jpg" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30241639-8928ec76-9544-11e7-931e-aeec1a948a21.jpg"><br /><small>Click to pop up larger image</small></a>

0. Install the latest Java Development Kit (JDK).

   The "J" in JHipster refers to the Java programming language. Thus the "java" in the Twitter account <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/java_hipster">@java_hipster</a>. 

   ## JHipster Generator Code

0. Go to the JHipster generator at <br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/">
   https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster</a>

   The first commit to the repo was by <a href="#JulienDubois">Julien Dubois</a> on October 21, 2013. He works at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ippon.fr/">Ippon in France</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ippon.tech/products/">US</a>, and Australia. Through collaboration by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.slideshare.net/julien.dubois/jhipster-overview-and-roadmap-august-2017">19 developers</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/">nearly 400 contributors on GitHub</a>, the JHipster generator is being used by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jhipster.tech/companies-using-jhipster/">20+ companies</a>.

   <img align="right" width="150" alt="jhipster-logo-400x507.svg.png" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/27997722-e11c2ac4-64bb-11e7-8620-cc7250eaf539.png">
   Tatooes on the neck of <a target="_blank" href="https://jhipster.github.io/">
   the JHipster cartoon character</a> are logos for the Java Spring Boot <a href="#BackEnd">back-end</a> and Angular <a href="#UIConfig">front-end library</a>. 

   <a target="_blank" href="https://gitter.im/jhipster/generator-jhipster">
   <strong>https://gitter.im/jhipster/generator-jhipster</strong></a> is where contributors hang out.

   There are two ways to make use of the JHipster generator:

   ![jhipster-base-repo-650x262-116385](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30228559-95337198-949b-11e7-8aaa-53ea48d409d5.jpg)

   <a name="CLIGeneratorDefault"></a>

   A) Fork, then clone into your local folder the repo for a <a href="#CustonApps">custom JHipster app</a> that a 3rd-party has generated. Instructions <a href="#3rdPartyApps">here</a>.

   B) Clone or download (then unzip) the generator repo into your local folder to run its command line program (`yo hipster`). The CLI enables you to specify options used during application code creation. Instructions <a href="#LocalGen">here</a>.

   C) In 2017 a JHipster cloud website was created to provide a form to select <a href="#WebGeneratorDefault">default options</a> the website uses to create application code. The steps for that:

   1). Install a Git client (if you haven't already).<br />
   2). Go to https://github.com/login and Login.<br />
   3). Click "+" to create a new public repo. I call it "JHipster-app1".<br />
   4). In a web browser, go to <a target="_blank" href="https://start.jhipster.tech/#/">
   JHipster Online at https://start.jhipster.tech</a> and Register.<br />
   5). In the email, click link to Activate. Sign-in on JHipster Online.<br />
   6). Authorize "JHipster by jhipster" to access your GitHub account.<br />

   NOTE: Revoke app access at https://github.com/settings/applications

0. Create/Generate app at <br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://start.jhipster.tech/#/generate-application">https://start.jhipster.tech/#/generate-application</a>
   
   ![jhipster-cloud-config1-650x440-104505](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30233655-26785e26-94b4-11e7-9cb0-a7bf91be2de3.jpg)

0. The default "jhipsterSampleApplication" doesn't need to change, but note that this is the name of your repository that JHipster generates. So no spaces in the name. This is also what JHipster displays on every UI page. 

   <a name="WebGeneratorDefault"></a>

0. Scroll down past all default selections.

   * Monolithic application type
   * port 8080 for the server
   * No to use of JHipster Registry to configure, monitor and scale your application
   * JWT authentication (stateless, with a token)
   * MySQL for production database
   * H2 in-memory database (with disk-based persistence) for dev work
   * Use Hibernate 2nd level cache, with encache (local encache, for a single node)
   * Maven (not Gradle) for building the backend
   * No internationalization support
   * JUnit, Karma, Gatling, Cucumber, Protractor
   <br /><br />

   NOTE: These selections are stored in <a href="#JHipsterInfo">file `.yo-rc.json`</a>, such as the one for the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wilsonmar/great-big-example-application/blob/master/.yo-rc.json">great-big-example-application</a>.

0. Click "Generate on GitHub".
0. Righ-click on the link, such as https://github.com/wilsonmar/jhipsterSampleApplication
0. Click Close.


   <a name="GitHubDownload"></a>

   ### Download from GitHub

0. In a Terminal, create or navigate to a folder where this command creates a folder, such as a folder containing your account name.

   <tt><strong>git clone https://github.com/wilsonmar/jhipsterSampleApplication.git
   </strong></tt>

   NOTE: At the time of writing, the download consists of 1,128,887 bytes (2.1 MB on disk) for 398 items.


   ##  Build App Code

   Now that app custom code is available (from following the steps above) ...

   ![jhipster-gend-650x264-104505](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30234442-5afa65f8-94ba-11e7-895e-261686687a30.jpg)


   ### Install NodeJs

0. Use these instructions for Windows and Mac/Linux.


   ### Install Ruby and Yeoman

   <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.legacyteam.info/2014/11/setup-yeoman-windows/">BLOG</a>

   Use these instructions for Windows:

0. Install Ruby on Windows from http://rubyinstaller.org/.
0. Install using Ruby's gem utility:

   <tt><strong>gem install bundler<br />
   gem install compass
   </strong></tt>

0. Install NodeJs from http://nodejs.org/. Be sure check "add path to environment variables" while installing.
0. Open Command Prompt. Install globally Bower, Grunt, Yeoman (yo command):

   <tt><strong>npm install -g bower grunt-cli yo 
   </strong></tt>


   ### Install Yarn package manager used by JHipster

   JHipster is about using the "hippest" (latest "shiny object"). By that I mean it enables uses of alternative tools becuase it integrates the alternative automatically when it generates app and DevOps code.

   For starters, instead of NPM (Node Package Manager) that comes with Node, JHipster uses its faster and more "reliable" alternative <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn">yarn</a>,
   which was released in <a target="_blank" href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/1840075619545360">October 2016 by Facebook</a> (in collaboration with Exponent, Google, and Tilde). Its <a target="_blank" href="https://registry.yarnpkg.com">https://registry.yarnpkg.com</a> goes to the https://www.cloudflare.com/ CDN.

0. Although yarn can be installed using NPM, that's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/node-js/yarn-a-package-manager-for-node-js">not recommended</a>. 
   
   On Windows, <a target="_blank" href="https://yarnpkg.com/latest.msi">click here to download the latest</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-tab">msi installer file</a>.

   On MacOS or Unix, use a curl command:

   <tt><strong>curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash
   </strong></tt>

   ### Yarn install (gen. lockfile)

0. Run yarn to create a <strong>node_modules</strong> folder and populate it based on specifications in the project's <strong>package.json</strong> file:

   <tt><strong>yarn install
   </strong></tt>

   In the response are:

   <pre>info No lockfile found.
   ...
   success Saved lockfile.
   </pre>

   NOTE: Yarn automatically creates a <strong>yarn.lock</strong> file saved with other assets in the repo. The file ensures that the same version of every single file and the exact same file structure of the node_modules directory is the same across all machines. By contrast, NPM's `npm-shrinkwrap.json` is generated manually by the `npm shrinkwrap` command. 

   Afterward, note the folder has grown to 284,269,020 bytes (409.9 MB on disk) for 45,877 items.


   ### .gitignore

0. The <strong>.gitignore</strong> file lists folders that yarn just created so that they don't get uploaded to GitHub.

   `/target/www/**` contains assets used by the web server.


   <a name="JHipsterInfo"></a>

   ## JHipster info

0. Navigate to the folder holding the app generated by JHipster

   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#issue">
   NOTE</a>: collect information about your installation using this command:

   <tt><strong>jhipster info
   </strong></tt>

   A sample response (looking for file `.yo-rc.json`):

   <a name="LaunchMaven"></a>

   ### Maven start

0. Start the back-end Java server:

   <tt><strong>./mvnw
   </strong></tt>

   This references specifications in the `application-dev.yml` file.

   Alternately, to deploy using "production" settings involves specifying a profile:

   <tt>./mvnw -Pprod
   </tt>

   This references specifications in the `application-prod.yml` file.

   Alternately, the Gradle command refers to the sample profile:

   <tt>./gradlew -Pprod
   </tt>

   To generate a WAR file, see http://www.jhipster.tech/production/




   <a name="YarnStart"></a>

   ### Yarn start processes

0. Open another Terminal.
0. PROTIP: Open a text editor to file `package.json` which is run by yarn. Scroll to the "scripts" section near the bottom. `"start": "yarn run webpack:dev"`. 
0. Navigate to the same folder to run `webpack:dev` server front end:

   <tt><strong>yarn start
   </strong></tt>

   A sample response in the command line console:

   <pre>
            factory:162ms building:1051ms = 1213ms
webpack: Compiled successfully.

   NOTE: IP address http://127.0.0.1 is equivalent to http://localhost

   NOTE: Make sure you started ./mvnw if you see an error such as this:

   <pre>

   NOTE: <a href="#CustomApps">Apps built based on JHipster</a> typically use another port, such as 9010.



   <hr />

   <a name="AdminSignIn"></a>

   ## Admin sign-in 

0. At the upper-right corner, click to expand <strong>Account</strong> to select Sign-in.

   ![jhipster-landing-register-244x134-16881](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30242044-7aa52c2a-954c-11e7-8fdc-8095b9196eca.jpg)

0. Sign-in using the built-in `admin` user and `admin` password for the Admin menu options:

0. Check "Remember Me" before clicking "Sign In".


   <a name="AdminMenu"></a>

   <img alt="jhipster-great-admin-menu-335x446-19k" width="200" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/29252305-60fbf382-8032-11e7-8bc3-e86ae276d96b.png">

   PROTIP: The wonder of JHipster generator is it generates a rather complete set of "back-end" server functionality.

   <a name="AdminMetrics"></a>

   ### Admin Metrics (Monitoring)

0. Click on Administrator to select <strong>Metrics</strong>.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://jhipster.github.io/images/screenshot_2.png"><img width="400" alt="jhipster_2-monitoring-800x498.png" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/27997908-013d956a-64bf-11e7-8d0c-9e9453d3ae2c.png"><br /><small>(click image for full-screen image)</small></a>

   This is possible because JVM monitoring agents were automatically installed on servers as part of JHipster generation.

   See http://www.jhipster.tech/monitoring/ about using Kibana in an ELK stack to display the JHipster Console. It presents visualization of distributed tracing from a Zipkin server working with correlation IDs to trace spans.


   <a name="AdminLogs"></a>

   ### Logs (Logging)

0. Click on Administrator to select <strong>Logs</strong>.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://jhipster.github.io/images/screenshot_4.png"><img width="400" alt="jhipster_4-logmgmt-800x406.png" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/27997957-1574de5c-64c0-11e7-9d8e-97de29109292.png"><br /><small>(click image for full-screen image)</small></a>

0. Click on another Level of logging, such as "TRACE", which provides the most verbose logging.




   <a name="SmallChange"></a>

   ## Make a small change 

   PROTIP: The "Agile" development philosophy is that small (incremental) changes are added over time to expose issues along the toolchain toward production.

   If the underlying component choices are not changed, we don't need to run JHipster Generator again.

0. To change the "This is your footer" text at the lower left corner of the JHipster default landing screen, open  Atom for the top folder and search to find the file `footer.component.html` within folder<br />
   `src/main/webapp/app/layouts/footer`



   <a name="BrowserSync"></a>

   ### BrowserSync

   After <a href="#Launch">launch</a> then <a href="#YarnStart">yarn start</a>, the "ui port 3001" is the user interface for the BrowserSync server, which automatically performs a page reload (like pressing Ctrl+R) when it detects a change to code. FYI, Detection occurs by it being setup as a proxy between the browser client and server. It then injects a javascript file on every page in order to make use of WebSockets to communicate between the server and the client to watch changes to your code or browser action. See browsersync.io.

   ![jhipster-browsersync-650x631-87432](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30241623-4416aba0-9544-11e7-966e-ce62739fff00.jpg)

   <a name="ChangeImages"></a>

   ## Change Images

   These file are referenced for display in file `home.css` within folder<br />
   `src/main/webapp/app/home/`

0. Create an uncompressed image file of <strong>694x994</strong> pixels named <br />
   `hipster2x.png` within folder `src/main/webapp/content/images`.

0. Create a compressed image file of <strong>347x497</strong> pixels named <br />
   `hipster.png` within folder `src/main/webapp/content/images`.

0. Create a compressed image file of <strong>94x119</strong> pixels named<br />
   `logo-jhipster.png` within folder `src/main/webapp/content/images` 
   to substitute the logo displayed on the upper-right corner of each page.

   NOTE: The Webpack utility moves this file within folder `src/main/Webpack` for display on browsers.

0. Create a compressed image file of the same <strong>94x119</strong> pixels named<br /> 
   `logo-jhipster.png` within folder `WebPack` to substitute the logo displayed on the upper-right corner of each page.

   This file is referenced for display in file `navbar.css` within folder<br />
   `src/main/webapp/app/layouts/navbar/`

   NOTE: The Webpack utility moves this file within folder `src/main/Webapp` for display on browsers.

   BLAH: Images and other files downloaded to clinets throughout the world should be in a CDN at various locations for faster retrieval by clients.


   <a name="AppName"></a>

   ## Change Application Name

   PROTIP: Due to code generation, html cannot be changed as if it's a static page.

0. Use a text editor to change the name shown at the upper left corner by editing file `application.yml` within folder `src/main/resources/config` 

   <pre>
spring:
    application:
        name: jhipsterSampleApplication
   </pre>


   <a name="UIConfig"></a>

   ## UI Configuration deep dive

   Let's now take a look into how the UI works. JHipster makes use of several leading technologies:

   ![jhipster-ui-tech-481x155-52666](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30281591-12c9692e-96d0-11e7-8769-486770decf12.jpg)


   <a name="AdminConfig"></a>

   ### Admin Config

0. Click on Administration to select <strong>Configuration</strong>. BLAH: Highlight all text on the page. 

   <a target="_blank" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30246573-9d14c10c-95bb-11e7-9ee5-a39051ca2933.jpg"><img alt="jhipster-admin-config-white-650x145-26577.jpg" width="650" height="145" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30246573-9d14c10c-95bb-11e7-9ee5-a39051ca2933.jpg"><br /><small>(click image for full-screen image)</small></a>

   QUESTION: <a href="#AngularDebug">why are properties hidden using a white font?</a>

   Properties under the `systemProperties` lable, such as PID, are obtained from the operating system.
   Properties under the `systemEnvironment` label, such as enviornment variable PATH, are obtained from the server.
   applicationConfig: [classpath:/config/application-dev.yml]
   applicationConfig: [classpath:/config/application.yml]
   refresh

   <a name="PageSource"></a>

   ### View Page Source

0. Right-click on a "white" part of the web page and select <strong>View Page Source</strong>.

   In the new browser tab, notice that there is not a lot of HTML.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://sqa.stackexchange.com/questions/18438/why-cant-we-use-selenium-webdriver-to-test-angular-js-sites">
   PROTIP</a>: This means that traditional functional testing software such as Selenium require Protractor to examine HTML and CSS generated dynamically on the client by Angular. 

   <a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25062969/testing-angularjs-with-selenium">
   PROTIP</a>: This means that functional testing scripts need to wait for pages to render. Selenium WebDriver is a tool/library that enables automation, whereas Protractor is a Test Runner/Test Framework which defines the design/structure of the automation.  SerenityBDD?

0. Use a text editor to view the index.html at<br />
   `/src/main/webapp/index.html`

   PROTIP: Uncomment the service worker for PWA.

   <pre>
        &LT;script>
            if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
                 navigator.serviceWorker
                    .register('./sw.js')
                    .then(function() { console.log('Service Worker Registered'); });
            }
        &LT;/script>
   </pre>

   PROTIP: Uncomment Google Analytics after replacing 'UA-XXXXX-X' with your own account code from Google.

   <pre>
    &LT;script>
        (function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
        function(){(b[l].q=b[l].q||[]).push(arguments)});b[l].l=+new Date;
        e=o.createElement(i);r=o.getElementsByTagName(i)[0];
        e.src='//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js';
        r.parentNode.insertBefore(e,r)}(window,document,'script','ga'));
        ga('create','UA-XXXXX-X');ga('send','pageview');
    &LT;/script>
   </pre>

   ### JavaScript

   The JavaScript files just before the `/body` tag ("under the fold") are:

   * app/manifest.bundle.js - for PWA
   * app/polyfills.bundle.js - for backward compatibility
   * app/vendor.bundle.js
   * app/main.bundle.js
   * app/global.bundle.js
   <br /><br />

   PROTIP: The app makes use of many JavaScript libraries, but each of them are not downloaded separately because <strong>Webpack</strong> was run to consolidate them into the above few client downloads.

   These .js files processed by Webpack are generated from <strong>.ts</strong> files, which denote <strong>TypeScript</strong> files that develpers code.


   ### Requires modern browser

   `[if lt IE 9]` means that those using Internet Explorer 8 or earlier would get the message:

   You are using an <strong>outdated</strong> browser. Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience.

   See <a href="http://browsehappy.com/"> browsehappy.com</a>.


   ### Backward Polyfill

   The shim.js polyfills all standard ECMAScript methods. The index.js polyfills non-standard methods.
      https://github.com/zloirock/core-js
   provides ES6 polyfill. See https://gitter.im/zloirock/core-js




   <a name="AngularDebug"></a>

   ### Angular debug

0. Right-click on a "white" part of the web page and select <strong>Inspect</strong> to use the browser's debugger.

   `<jhi-main ng-version="4.3.2">` near the top means that <strong>Angular 4</strong> is being used.

   BTW, "AngularJs" refers to the Angular1.x framework at
   <a target="_blank" href="http://angularjs.blogspot.com/2016/12/ok-let-me-explain-its-going-to-be.html">AngularJS.org</a>. Plain "Angular" refers to a current version (at angular.org):

   * Angular 2 initially was not back-compatible until Typescript.
   * Angular 3 is skipped as a version number.
   * Angular 4 on 2017-03 (backward compatible with Angular 2)
   * Angular 5 on 2017-09
   * Angular 6 on 2018-03
   * Angular 7 on 2018-09
   <br /><br />

0. Click the arrows in the Inspect window to look into each level of HTML:

   ![jhipster-inspect-table-688x407-169050](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30249919-10c592ec-9603-11e7-8c53-e0ad091f4200.jpg)

   PROTIP: Traditional tables are being used here, not CSS.

   ### Bootstrap responsive CSS

   `<div class="col-md-8">` is a marker used by the <strong>Bootstrap</strong> library for "responsive" CSS that shows different layouts depending on the size of the screen detected on the client browser used.
   
   The Bootstrap and Font-awesome SVG icon library is pulled into the client by `@import` statements in<br />
   `src/main/webapp/content/css/vendor.css`

   <pre>
/* after changing this file run 'yarn run webpack:build' */
@import '~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
@import '~font-awesome/css/font-awesome.css';
   </pre>

0. Click into rows to see where "null" is defined:

   ![jhipster-inspect-null-685x283-91935](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30250095-22f76050-9606-11e7-9eb5-bd1f638db274.jpg)

   `<span class="float-right badge badge-default break">null</span>`

   This is in file `configuration.component.html` within folder<br />
   `src/main/webapp/app/admin/configuration/`

   JHipster's overrides of Bootstrap CSS is specified in<br />
   `src/main/webapp/content/css/global.css`

   There's a background-color rule for .badge-default in bootstrap v4.0.0-alpha.6

   QUESTION: Where is that?

   <a name="EmailServer"></a>

   #### Configure email server

   See https://jhipster.github.io/tips/011_tip_configuring_email_in_jhipster.html

0. Use a text editor to edit file `application-dev.yml` within folder `src/main/resources/config` to change:

   <pre>
    mail:
        host: localhost
        port: 25
        username:
        password:
   </pre>

   CAUTION: This approach exposes credentials to the email server. 
   QUESTION: Can it use Hashicorp Vault to manage secrets?

0. Use a text editor to edit file `messages.properties` within folder `src/main/resources/i18n/` to change text appearing in emails:

   <pre>
# Activation email
email.activation.title=jhipsterSampleApplication account activation
email.activation.greeting=Dear {0}
email.activation.text1=Your jhipsterSampleApplication account has been created, please click on the URL below to activate it:

   PROTIP: The JHipster generator creates a full-featured user registration form, with password strength indicator, password reset, etc.

   QUESTION: What are the permissible password rules? Helloworld2

0. After clicking "Register", do not allow the browser to save the password.

   The response message:

   <pre>Registration saved! Please check your email for confirmation.

   NOTE: This is for the default H2 database chosen during <a href="#WebGeneratorDefault">JHipster Generator default selections</a>.


   #### Liquibase db schema tracking

   Within folder `src/main/resources/config/liquibase` are <strong>changelog</strong> files in XML human readable yet trackable format so that changes to database schemas can be checked into source control, which enables refactoring. The other files in the folder define permissions.
 
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.methodsandtools.com/tools/tools.php?liquibase">NOTE</a>:Liquibase (at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.liquibase.org/">liquibase.org</a> and licensed <a target="_blank" href="http://www.datical.com/">datical</a> for enterprises) provides commands such as update, rollback, and diff (difference) to schema changes in JDBC databases.

   JHipster generates code from an <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model">"entity data model"</a> that talks about business-level objects, not technical entities. An example:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30143332-7b0da9f0-9342-11e7-99c6-b322481fe4a6.jpg"><img alt="jhipster-entity-572x562-98906" width="572" height="562" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30143332-7b0da9f0-9342-11e7-99c6-b322481fe4a6.jpg"></a>

   #### Java main source

0. Let's dive into the Java main app code directories:

   <tt><strong>cd src/main/
   </strong></tt>

   This contains <strong>docker</strong> container coding.

   The <strong>webapp</strong> folder contains much of the static files
   in the target www folder generated.

0. Lower...

   <tt><strong>cd src/main/java/org/exampleapps/greatbig
   </strong></tt>

   `GreatBigExampleApplicationApp.java` is the code providing the entry point.

   `ApplicationWebXml.java` is used for logging, referencing folder<br />
   `aop` (Aspect Oriented Programming).

   `security` holds the jwt and social sign-in code.

   `config` holds sub-classes for audit, social, etc.

   `domain` holds classes corresponding to the Entities in the UI.

   `repository` holds classes defining the persistant layer (database).

   `service` holds utility code used by services.

   `web` holds web and websocket network resource code.

   These use a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Data_transfer_object">
   DTO (Data Transfer Object)</a> that reduces the number of round-trip calls by aggregating several calls into one call only. DTOs do not have behavior except for remote storage and retrieval of its own data (mutators and accessors), so they don't require testing.


   #### Java testing source

0. Let's dive into the Java test code directories:

   <tt><strong>cd src/test
   </strong></tt>

   This contains <strong>gatling</strong> performance/load client emulation code.

0. Lower...

   <tt><strong>cd src/test/java/org/exampleapps/greatbig
   </strong></tt>

   This has unit tests structured the same way as the main source files.



   Let's take a look at the various back-end DevSecOps technologies:

   i18n (internationalization)

   In a Gateway server, Zuul Proxy software
   distributes traffic to AngularJS app servers.

   For Access Control apps reference a 
   JHipster UAA (User Authentication and Authorization) server containing user role information.

   Apps reference 
   Ribbon
   handles WebSocket calls to servers handling various microservices.

   Hashicorp Consul 
   
   JHipster Registry
   contains a Eureka server that ...
   and a Spring cloud Config server.
   These servers are provided by Netflix.
   They access Git repos.

   The JHipster Console consists of a Elasticsearch database fed by
   logs ingested by Logstash and displayed by Kibana.
   Administration of this ELK stack is accessed by a separate browser 
   instance on port 5601 by default. 
   Logs managed make use of default port 5000.

   ### Netflix OSS

   Netflix OSS (<a target="_blank" href="https://netflix.github.io/">netflix.github.io</a>)
   is a set of frameworks and libraries that Netflix wrote to solve some interesting distributed-systems problems at scale. 

   <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/how-we-build-code-at-netflix-c5d9bd727f15">
   NOTE</a>: 
   Netflix OSS can be used w/out Spring Cloud.

   <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.christianposta.com/microservices/netflix-oss-or-kubernetes-how-about-both/">
   NOTE</a>: In addition to AWS cloud, Netflix OSS can run on Docker with Kubernetes, which comes with lots of “distributed-systems features” out of the box.
   <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/zerotodocker-an-easy-way-to-evaluate-netflixoss-through-runtime-packaging-845db21cb60b">"Zero to docker"</a> images on http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cnetflix
   allows anyone with a Docker host (on their laptop, on a VM in the cloud, etc.) to, with a single command, run a single node of any NetflixOSS technology.

     The installation process will start below. Human interaction may be
     required at some points. If you're uncomfortable with automatically
     installing this provider, you can safely Ctrl-C this process and install
     it manually.
==>  Downloading VirtualBox 5.0.10...
     This may not be the latest version of VirtualBox, but it is a version
     that is known to work well. Over time, we'll update the version that
     is installed.
==>  Installing VirtualBox. This will take a few minutes...
     You may be asked for your administrator password during this time.
     If you're uncomfortable entering your password here, please install
     VirtualBox manually.
Password:
==>  VirtualBox has successfully been installed!
A Vagrant environment or target machine is required to run this
command. Run `vagrant init` to create a new Vagrant environment. Or,
get an ID of a target machine from `vagrant global-status` to run
this command on. A final option is to change to a directory with a
Vagrantfile and to try again.
   </pre>

   <a target="_blank" href="http://127.0.0.1:2222">
   127.0.0.1:2222</a>

   Do this quickly or you'll see:

   <pre>
Timed out while waiting for the machine to boot. This means that
Vagrant was unable to communicate with the guest machine within
the configured ("config.vm.boot_timeout" value) time period.
&nbsp;
If you look above, you should be able to see the error(s) that
Vagrant had when attempting to connect to the machine. These errors
are usually good hints as to what may be wrong.
&nbsp;
If you're using a custom box, make sure that networking is properly
working and you're able to connect to the machine. It is a common
problem that networking isn't setup properly in these boxes.
Verify that authentication configurations are also setup properly,
as well.
&nbsp;
If the box appears to be booting properly, you may want to increase
the timeout ("config.vm.boot_timeout") value.

   ### Run Generator

   PROTIP: One of the great advantages of using a code generator is
   having different options to do a similar thing.
   
0. Create or Navigate to your app's folder.

   Unlike other Java app generators, Yeoman expects to be in the directory 
   where it creates your project rather than creating it for you.

0. Initiate generation:

   <pre><strong>yo jhipster
   </strong></pre>

   BTW, this same command is used to upgrade as well.

   The generator asks a series of questions (15 or so).

   QUESTION: Is there sample automation to answer questions?

   ? (1/16) Which *type* of application would you like to create?

   * Monolithic
   * Services ???


   <a name="SubGenerators"></a>

   ### Sub-generators

   "import-jdl" sub-generator generates a complex entity model using JDL Studio

   "entity" sub-generator generates a complete JPA entity, from database to Angular

   "service" sub-generator generates a Spring business service

   "languages" sub-generator adds languages for i18n (Spanish)


   ### Configuration files

   shows how to build a microservices architecture with JHipster 4.5.4. Generate a gateway (powered by Netflix Zuul and the JHipster Gateway), a microservice (that talks to MongoDB), and use Docker Compose to make sure it all runs locally.
