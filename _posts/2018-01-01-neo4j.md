This tutorial is an introduction for noobs on how to <a href="#Install">install Neo4J</a>, <a href="#Configure">configure</a>, <a href="#CreateDB">create a database from commands</a>,<a href="LoadData">load data</a>, and do <a href="#Queries">simple queries</a>. Rather than innudating you with facts and conceptual words to remember, commentary here is provided along the way after you take some action, step-by-step. Like a guided walking tour. Learn by doing.

## Why graph databases?

Graph databases is the latest in the evolution of data storage mechanisms:

![neo4j-evolution-828x394-72052.jpg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/34469117-20b4bd9c-eed5-11e7-9967-f652cc2d67ca.jpg)

Although databases from Oracle, MySQL, etc. need commands to join physical tables together, graph databases manages connection of nodes (data entities) in relationship to other nodes. 
  
In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GekQqFZm7mA&t=7m49s">
VIDEO: Graph Databases Will Change Your Freakin' Life</a>
   published Nov 28, 2016, Ed Finkler (CTO of SaaS vendor <a target="_blank" href="https://graphstory.com/">GraphStory.com</a>)
   presents this sample graph:<br />
![neo4j-child-of-484x177-27830](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/34467745-77068856-eeb7-11e7-835c-923f9f673764.jpg)

The two nodes (data records) are labeled of entity type "Person".
The arrow in the relationship line points from the "CHILD_OF" in the direction of the parent.
A property of this relationship (named "Created") is when the relationship was established (in "2002").

Unique to graph databases is the ability to attach labels to relationships which can be used to narrow searches. SQL cannot label foreign keys and require bridge tables to be built.

The advantage of Neo4j appears when we work with complex <strong>indirect relationships</strong>. The approach of graph databases build in <strong>"meaning"</strong> within data. 
This has proven useful for use cases such as recommendations, network/IT analysis, fraud detection, Internet of Things(IoT), and more. 

In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiqLhlG4CkU">
VIDEO: What are Graph Databases and Why should I care?</a>
Mar 23, 2017,
Dave Bechberger (@bechbd of <a target="_blank" href="http://graph.experolabs.com/">Expero Labs</a>) explains that with Neo4j, one can easilly "travese" a graph with arbitrary hops such as "similar" to identify a recommandation:

![neo4j-lunchbox-hops-866x365-48889](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/34469032-106f48f0-eed3-11e7-8dbc-780e3dda5a25.jpg)

With Neo4j, one can easilly "travese" a graph with arbitrary hops such as "similar"

SQL is hard due to the need for joins and "de-normalized" physical structures.
SQL makes it difficult to answer questions that were not already expected ahead of time,
requiring refactoring.

However, as more relationships are added, performance is not degraded with joins.




## Other Graph databases

@JanusGraph ‚Äè JanusGraph (at http://janusgraph.org/)
was open-sourced in 2017 under The Linux Foundation, with participants from Google, Hortonworks, IBM, Amazon, GRAKN.AI, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.experolabs.com/">Expero Labs</a>, etc.

It's distributed graph database with multiple scalable storage backends:

   * Apache Cassandra¬Æ
   * Apache HBase¬Æ
   * Google Cloud Bigtable
   * Oracle BerkeleyDB

http://tinkerpop.apache.org/
http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/3.2.4/reference/#traversal

### Cloud instances

   https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/graph-introduction">Apache TinkerPop Gremlin</a> queries on DataStax Enterprise Graph
   * RDF/SPARQL
   * Transactional /OLTP
   * Analytics /OLAP
   <br /><br />

   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/spark-connector-graph
   Microsoft offers its Cosmos graph database 
   running within a Azure HDInsight Spark cluster 2.0

### Enterprise unlock
   
   Neo4j installers include Desktop and Enterprise which requires buying a license (unless the application built on top of it is also open-sourced) to unlock limitations, allowing for LDAP role-based and subgraph access control, lock manager, clustering, hot backups, and monitoring. 
   See https://neo4j.com/startup-program/?ref=developers


<a name="Install"></a>

## Installation

   PROTIP: If you value your data, don't install. Instead of hacking your way, pay a SaaS vendor such as <a target="_blank" href="https://graphstory.com/">GraphStory.com</a>.

1. Install Java JDK.

   ### Install Neo4J on Mac

   If you're installing on your laptop, I recommend use of Homebrew.

3. Homebrew install on Mac or Linux from any folder:

   <pre><strong>
   brew install neo4j
   </strong></pre>

   The response presents tips for starting the server:

   <pre>
==> Downloading https://neo4j.com/artifact.php?name=neo4j-community-3.3.0-unix.tar.gz
######################################################################## 100.0%
==> Caveats
To have launchd start neo4j now and restart at login:
  brew services start neo4j
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  neo4j start
==> Summary
üç∫  /usr/local/Cellar/neo4j/3.3.0: 105 files, 96.9MB, built in 7 minutes 10 seconds
   </pre>

   <a name="EnvVar"></a>

   ### Configure Environment Variable

   PROTIP: The Summary response provides a hint of where Neo4j's binary is located.

4. Create an environment to hold a path to the goodies:

   <pre><strong>
   export NEO4J_HOME="/usr/local/Cellar/neo4j/3.3.0/libexec/"
   echo $NEO4J_HOME
   ls $NEO4J_HOME
   </strong></pre>

   The response:

   <pre>
/usr/local/Cellar/neo4j/3.3.0/libexec/
LICENSES.txt   bin      conf     import      logs     run
UPGRADE.txt certificates   data     lib      plugins
   </pre>   

   Now skip to the <a href="#Invoke">Invoke</a> section. 

   Alternately:

## Manual download

1. In an internet browser, go to Neo4J's Other Releases to download:

   <a target="_blank" href="
   https://neo4j.com/download/other-releases/">
   https://neo4j.com/download/other-releases/</a>

2. Click the "Download" button for sign-ups

3. Get the OReilly book.

   ### Manual install

   neo4j-desktop-1.0.9.dmg

4. Click "Open" to "Are you sure you want to open it?".
5. Click "I Agree".
6. Login using your email or through social media.

   NOTE: It says Java 8 is downloaded if it doesn't exist, but I got errors.

7. Set an environment variable to point to where Neo4j is installed.



   ### Release

   Note 1.0.9 is the release on which this tutorial is written.

https://neo4j.com/download-thanks-desktop/?edition=desktop&flavour=osx&release=1.0.9


<a name="Invoke"></a>

## Invoke

1. We don't want/need a background service, so:

   <pre><strong>
   neo4j start
   </strong></pre>

   If you had installed using Homebrew:

   <pre>
Active database: graph.db
Directories in use:
  home:         /usr/local/Cellar/neo4j/3.3.0/libexec
  config:       /usr/local/Cellar/neo4j/3.3.0/libexec/conf
  logs:         /usr/local/Cellar/neo4j/3.3.0/libexec/logs
  plugins:      /usr/local/Cellar/neo4j/3.3.0/libexec/plugins
  import:       /usr/local/Cellar/neo4j/3.3.0/libexec/import
  data:         /usr/local/Cellar/neo4j/3.3.0/libexec/data
  certificates: /usr/local/Cellar/neo4j/3.3.0/libexec/certificates
  run:          /usr/local/Cellar/neo4j/3.3.0/libexec/run
Starting Neo4j.
Started neo4j (pid 21292). It is available at http://localhost:7474/
There may be a short delay until the server is ready.
See /usr/local/Cellar/neo4j/3.3.0/libexec/logs/neo4j.log for current status.
   </pre>

   Alternately, to start neo4j now and automaticaly restart at login:

   <pre><strong>
   brew services start neo4j
   </strong></pre>


   <a name="Configure"></a>

   ### Edit Config for upgrade

3. Edit the configuration file using "subl" or substituting "vi" or your text editor:

   <pre><strong>
   subl $NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf
   </strong></pre>

   See a description of the dozens of keys at:
   https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/3.2/reference/configuration-settings/

4. Find this setting.
5. Remove the # comment so your database upgrades automatically in case its built version is older than your current Neo4j version:

   <pre>
   dbms.allow_upgrade=true
   </pre>

6. Save the file and exit the editor.

   PROTIP: Alternately, rather than doing the above by hand,
   I recommend that you create and store in GitHub a shell script that does the above, then execute it a single command.

   <pre>
   curl -o https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wilsonmar/Dockerfiles/master/Neo4j/conf/neo4j.conf
   </pre>

    `-o` (lowercase o) the result will be saved in the filename provided in the command line.

    `-O` (uppercase O) the filename in the URL will be taken and it will be used as the filename to store the result

   <pre>
   curl -o your.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wilsonmar/Dockerfiles/master/Neo4j/conf/neo4j.conf
   </pre>


   <a name="Console"></a>

   ### Start Browser Console

7. Open the Neo4j Browser client.

   In Linux, open a browser different than the one used to display this tutorial
   (Firefox instead of Chrome) so you can quickly switch among the two using Command+Tab,
   go to the URL suggested above:

   <a target="_blank" href="
   http://localhost:7474/">
   http://localhost:7474/</a>

   Alternately, when <a target="_blank" href="https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/3.2/installation/docker/">running within Docker Machine</a>, open the Neo4j Browser client using your default browser. On a Mac:

   <pre><strong>
   open http://$(docker-machine ip default):7474
   </strong></pre>


   ### Ports

   PROTIP: By default the Docker image for Neo4j exposes three ports for remote access:

   <pre>
docker run \
    --publish=7474:7474 --publish=7687:7687 \
    --volume=$HOME/neo4j/data:/data \
    --volume=$HOME/neo4j/logs:/logs \
    neo4j:3.2
    </pre>

   * 7474 for HTTP
   * 7473 for HTTPS
   * 7687 for Bolt
   <br /><br />

   PROTIP: Neo4j uses the <strong>Bolt</strong> binary protocol (instead of "http") to communicate with the Neo4j database.

   ### Dark theme color for commands

3. Click the gear icon near the lower-left corner among menu icons.

   <a name="SampleConsole"></a>

   <a target="_blank" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/34465151-4dc9ded8-ee5e-11e7-87d8-e3a92d459795.png">
   <img width="1174" alt="neo4j-console" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/34465151-4dc9ded8-ee5e-11e7-87d8-e3a92d459795.png"></a>

4. Click Theme Dark.
5. Click the icon again to dismiss the menu. (it's a toggle)

   <strong>Commands</strong> can be entered in the Editor field at the top which begins with a dollar sign in gray.

   ### Play intro

6. Click the icon that looks like a book (previously this was an i icon for information).
7. Click "Getting Started".

   Notice that these commands appear in the command field:

   <pre><strong>
   :play intro
   </strong></pre>

   Notice that the commands now have different colors.

8. To submit the command, press Enter or click the arrow icon at the upper-right corner.

   The page says for multi-line commands to press Shift+Enter to enter multi-line mode,
   then press Ctrl+Enter instead of the arrow icon.

9. Scroll down the page to see that the new response is added above the previous frame, as in a stack as a stream.
10. Click the gray X to dismiss a content frame.
11. Click "Operations Manual" under Useful Resources to pop up a new browser tab to the version installed: https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/3.2/


   ### Manage roles

   The Enterprise edition of ???


   ### Change password

   Notice in the <a href="#SampleConsole">sample console image</a> that the password is blank.

12. Change the password:

   https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/3.2/reference/user-management-community-edition/#userauth-list-all-users-ce

   https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/3.2/tutorial/role-based-access-control/
 
    CALL dbms.security.listUsers()


    <a name="CreateDB"></a>
   
## Database creation commands



   ### Movie sample

In Neo4j Browser 

1. Open one of the two sample datasets:

   <pre><strong>
   :play movie graph
   </strong></pre>

   ### Data Model

   The sample database containing relationships among actors and directors in movies is illustrated by this "data model":

   "neo4j-movies-1971x1059.png"

   This is like ER (Entity-Relation) diagrams for SQL databaeses.

   PROTIP: Neo4J data is stored the same way as illustrated by the data model, whereas with SQL data is stored in separate tables joined together.

   PLUG: Thus, Neo4j is naturally adaptive because it requires no schema migrations.


   ### Northwind

   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO3C-CWykkY&index=4&list=PL9Hl4pk2FsvWM9GWaguRhlCQ-pa-ERd4U&t=12m42s

   In Neo4j, relationships can have properties.

   Neo4j uses "index read adjacency" makes it quicker to traverse nodes
   instead of slower index lookups in SQL.

   Relations are not first-class citizens in a relational database.

1. Open the Northwind database which Microsoft provides with its SQL database.

   :play northwind graph



<hr />


<a name="LoadData"></a>

## Load data

1. First, stop the service:

   <a name="StopBrowser"></a>

   ### Stop Browser

2. Open a Terminal window to issue command:

   <pre><strong>
   neo4j stop
   </strong></pre>

   The response:

   <pre>Stopping Neo4j.. stopped
   </pre>

   Now you can backup and dump the database.

3. Switch to or open a Mac/Linux Terminal instance and:

   <pre><strong>
   cd $NEO4J_HOME/data/Databases
   ls -al
   cd graph.db
   ls -al
   </strong></pre>

   Notice <strong>graph.db</strong>.

   PROTIP: In the Neo4j world, a physical database consists of files stored under a folder named with a .db suffix. A "graph" references a physical Neo4j database that stores data.




<hr />

4. Click the star icon on the menu to reveal the import area to drag files.

   <img width="235" alt="neo4j-import-drop" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/34465239-ba7669b2-ee62-11e7-87f9-f0c01e4688d9.png">

   Only text files are dropped there, not images of Neo4j databases (.db files).

   See <a href="#Importing">Importing</a> below.


   <a name="BackupDB"></a>

   ### Backup default database

   see https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/3.2/tools/dump-load/
   for the various attributes to add.


   <a name="DownloadSampleDB"></a>

   ### Download sample database

16. Stop the server.
17. Open a new browser tab to download a zip file containing a sample database from:

    <a target="_blank" href="
    https://neo4j.com/developer/example-data/">
    https://neo4j.com/developer/example-data</a>

18. Right-click to <strong>Save Link as...</strong> (download) the Jim Webber‚Äôs Doctor Who Data Set <strong>drwho.zip</strong> file to your Downloads folder.
19. Unzip the file to create folder <strong>drwho</strong>.
20. Look into the folder index.

   PROTIP: Neo4j uses Lucene to index, same as ElasticSearch and others.

21. Copy the drwho folder within the Neo4j database folder:

   <pre><strong>
   cp ~/Downloads/drwho  /usr/local/Cellar/neo4j/3.3.0/libexec/data/Databases
   ls
   </strong></pre>

   ### Check db consistency

22. See https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/3.2/tools/consistency-checker/

relationships from the movie "Matrix".

As of version 2.0, indexing was added to Cypher with the introduction of schemas.[15] 


<a name="Query"></a>

## Cypher Query

https://www.opencypher.org/#resources

A big innovation by Neo4j is that it provides programmers with a flexible network structure of nodes and relationships rather than static SQL tables.

Cypher is a language akin to SQL.

<a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/artifacts.opencypher.org/M08/docs/style-guide.pdf">
Cypher Style Guide (for M08), a 10-page pdf</a>
covers Indentation and line breaks, Meta-characters, Casing, Patterns Spacing. The document presents this classical piece by Mark Needham:
as a "sane query":

<pre>
MATCH (member:Member {name: 'Mark Needham'})
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†-[:HAS_MEMBERSHIP]->()-[:OF_GROUP]->(:Group)-[:HAS_TOPIC]->(topic)
WITH member, topic, count(*) AS score
MATCH (topic)<-[:HAS_TOPIC]-(otherGroup:Group)
WHERE NOT (member)-[:HAS_MEMBERSHIP]->(:Membership)-[:OF_GROUP]->(otherGroup)
RETURN otherGroup.name, collect(topic.name), sum(score) AS score
ORDER BY score DESC
</pre>

   PROTIP: Do not use a semicolon at the end of the statement.

  execution plan with EXPLAIN and PROFILE.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TSBXZMv6tc

https://neo4j.com/download-thanks-desktop/docs/developer-manual/current/cypher/#how-do-i-profile-a-query

   Neo4j is considered among other "NOSQL" database tech that include
   Key-Value Stores, Column-Family Stores, and Document Databases.
   But these others use aggregate data models whereas graph databases
   such as Neo4j work with simple records and complex interactions.

   Instead of SQL union statements.
   an example of code is:

<pre>
	(graphs)-[:ARE]->(everywhere)
</pre>

   ### Direction

   Neo4j API allow developers to completely ignore relationship direction
   when querying the graph.

<pre>
MATCH (boss)-[:MANAGES*0..3]->(sub),
      (sub)-[:MANAGES*1..3]->(report)
WHERE boss.name = "John Doe"
RETURN sub.name AS subordinate,
   count(report) AS Total
</pre>

<a name="Importing"></a>

## Import your own data

You can import your data from CSV files using the Cypher's LOAD CSV command. 

https://neo4j.com/developer/guide-import-csv/

Learn more about import in the Neo4j Developer Manual: Load CSV and Importing CSV Data into Neo4j.

   https://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/3.0/cypher/#query-load-csv

   https://neo4j.com/developer/guide-import-csv/

Of course, Neo4j believes in polyglot persistence as well - so we're happy if Neo4j is just one part of your overall architecture and storing your connected data, while your columnar, tabular and document data is stored elsewhere. Learn more about the various types of data integrations possible with Neo4j.

## Awesome Procedures

APOC (Awesome Procedures on Cypher) are complex implementations that can't be expressed directly on Cypher. They suppor data integration, graph algorithms, data conversion.

   https://neo4j-contrib.github.io/neo4j-apoc-procedures/index32.html

refers to the code repository at:

   https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2013/01/optimizing-neo4j-cypher-queries.html">PROTIP</a>:
Have every cypher query use parameters - as stated in the Neo4j documentation.

<a name="JavaCoding"></a>

## Java coded queries

https://neo4j.com/blog/efficient-graph-algorithms-neo4j/

For large amounts of data, Cypher run time performance may not equal that of Java API coding of traversals and writes. So do massive writes using java api and reads and queries using parameterized Cypher queries. 

Neo4j provides Native server-side extensions in Java. 

Get the official drivers for Javascript, Java, .NET, and Python

   https://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/drivers/#driver-get-the-driver

Additionally, the community has built a wide variety of other drivers in languages like PHP, Ruby, Go, Haskell and more.

   https://neo4j.com/developer/language-guides/

https://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/procedures/


### ALGO libraries

Neo4j has surrounded itself with a rich ecosphere of visualization and analytics tools. It's open source query language, OpenCypher, is the most widely used graph query language. 

Neo4j likely has more documentation that all other graph tools combined. When you run into problems or have questions, you'll find a large community of users and meetup groups around the world. 

If you are just getting started with graphs, you can't go wrong by learning Neo4j.
