This tutorial describes how you can secure your account and avoid runaway bills.

## Basic account lockdown

1. Create an AWS account with a credit card and an email.

   <a target="_blank" href="
   https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home">
   https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home</a>

   The account which controls billing is called the <strong>root account</strong>, which as unlimited access to AWS resources and unlimited ability to rack up charges.   

2. In the AWS Console 

   <a target="_blank" href="
   https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home">
   https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home</a>

3. Click to view all <strong>Services</strong> at the upper-left black menu band.
4. Scroll to the category "Security, Identify, and Compliance" list of ever-growing services:

   * Click "Artifact" (at the bottom of the list) to read documents associated with security certifications.
   * Cognito provides an API to federate authentication with various social identity providers.

   What's not listed is the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html?icmpid=docs_iam_console">AWS Best Practices</a> which this tutorial addresses.

5. Click <strong>IAM</strong> (for Identity Access Management) for the list <strong>Security Status</strong>

6. Click on "Delete your root access key".

7. Check "Don't show me this message again" and Continue to Security Credentials.

   ### Password

8. PROTIP: Use 1Password to store your passwords so that you can use a "strong" password of so many characters that it will take hackers too much time to crack it. Because you only have to remember one master password, you can are free to change various passwords as often as you want with no fear of forgetting them.

   ### MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)

   Have AWS text or call your smartphone (a virtual device) to make sure that it's really you logging in.

9. Click <strong>Activate MFA</strong>

10. Click "A virtual MFA device".
11. Click Next Steps.
12. On your iPhone or Android, open up your QR code app and align the code visually. My favorite app is Norton Snap, which blocks out malicious URLs the image represents. The app visits the website represented by the picture of dots.
