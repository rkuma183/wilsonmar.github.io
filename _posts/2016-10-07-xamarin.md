This article is a hands-on deep-dive tutorial about installing and using
Microsoft's Xamarin app development IDE and framework to create 
iOS and Android apps using the C# language.

This page provides PROTIPs that highlight hard-won experience not available elsewhere.


## Competitors

Xamarin's main competitor in the <strong>multi-platform mobile development tools</strong> 
market is Facebook's React Native, which also generates native code, but from JavaScript coding
rather than C# coding. 

Although Kony is rated highly by Gartner, 
it is now focused on volume deals with large shops rather than getting individuals working.

<a target="_blank" href="https://kivy.org/">Kivy</a>
generates mobile code from Python code.
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqdpK9KjGgQ">
See Russell Keith-Magee's talk</a> May 2016 about his
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pybee/Python-iOS-template/">
Python-iOS-template on GitHub</a> and explained on
pybee.org and
http://omz-software.com/pythonista/


## Run-times on mobile #

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono-project</a> 
is the run-time engine equivalent to 
Microsoft's .NET Core on other platforms. 
It implements .NET APIs and plays with .NET Standard so you don’t have to worry about 
 implmentations "under the hood".

In fact, there is a single .NET super optmized runtime that brings 
.NET to iOS, Android, macOS, Apple tvOS, IoT, Linux, PS4, Xbox, etc. 

   Some marketing materials say "15%-30%" of all code is shared among platforms.
   But you'll need to see for yourself.

Xamarin "works with"
<a target="_blank" href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/wear/">
Android Wear</a> and
<a target="_blank" href="http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/watch/">
Apple Watch</a> worn on wrists
in the sense that programs (WearService.cs) communicate with them,
Xamarin does not actually run on them.


Examples of device platform-specific code include access to:

   * system information (such as battery life)
   * personal information (such as device name)
   * folders and files on the device
   * external devices (such as Bluetooth)
   * notifications
   <br /><br />


On April, 2016, 
Microsoft open sourced Xamarin at
http://open.xamarin.com/

   * https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios
   * https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android
   * https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms

PROTIP: Microsoft's Windows Phone is a dead product.

We are only talking about Android and iOS here when we say "mobile devices".


<a name="PreBuilt"></a>

## Pre-built apps in Azure cloud

Microsoft's Azure cloud was first announced in 2008 and released in 2010.

CAUTION: This section under construction:

   PROTIP: Instead of clicking to download one or more of the Forms apps,
   first install the app without building from source code from 
   https://github.com/xamarin/app-crm/wiki/Install-the-app-NOW-without-building-from-source-code

Even before software is installed locally,
experience a pre-built app running live on Microsoft's cloud at:

### Azure Quick Starts

## Buy MSDN license

0. To buy the MSDN subscription with an email you'll be using to build software:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/pricing/">
   https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/pricing</a> says 
   Visual Studio Enterprise is<br />
   <strong>$5,999</strong> for the first year and then each additional year<br />
   $2,569. However, some Microsoft Partners sell it for less.

   However, Mac users now still need an <strong>Enterprise Visual Studio</strong> 
   license.

0. Use the email you used to get your license to login MSDN.com,
   Subscriptions at:<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/manage/hh442900">
   https://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/manage/hh442900</a>.

0. Scroll down to <strong>Xamarin Studio (for OSX)</strong> and 
   click "Register and Download".

   NOTE: Xamarin was an independent organization (in San Francisco) 
   which charged <strong>$5,697 per user per year per platform</strong>.

   See https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/license/

0. To create a Xamarin account if you don't already have one,<br />
   click Subscribe.

   Microsoft bought Xamarin Feb. 2016
   (announced at Build 2016), so there is still a separate system at the end of 2016.

   PROTIP: Notice it's an annual renewal.

   PROTIP: Work on Xamarin Studio has stopped on Windows.
   Microsoft is working on a Visual Studio for Mac.

## Install Xamarin Platform IDEs #

TODO: A bootstrap script that installs everything needed in a single command.

For installation, Xamarin University classes direct students to 
<a target="_blank" href="https://university.xamarin.com/content/setupmenu">
these</a>:

* <a target="_blank" href="https://university.xamarin.com/resources/mac-setup">
   Mac Setup</a>

* <a target="_blank" href="https://university.xamarin.com/resources/win-setup">
   Windows Setup</a>


   "Platform" here refers to the tools to develop software.

   An Apple Mac machine is needed only to compile code to run on Apple iOS devices.
   One can NOT be shared. 
   So the MacInCloud service connects each Windows machine with a separate Mac.

   NOTE: Xamarin Studio is customized from the open-source MonoDevelop IDE.

   NOTE: Xamarin Studio is no longer available on Windows.

   <strong>Parallels</strong> software, not being true virtualization, 
   is an advantage is this case.
   On a Mac, one can install <strong>Parallels</strong> software,
   then install Windows 10 and Visual Studio 2015 for Windows inside that,
   and you'll be able to run Windows Phone emulators as well.
   

0. If you're behind a corporate firewall proxy, talk to your security officer about
   <strong>whitelisting</strong> these hosts installers reference:

   * dl-ssl.google.com
   * dl.google.com
   * xamarin.com
   * download.xamarin.com
   * dl.xamarin.com
   * log.xamarin.com
   <br /><br />

   This tip is from 
   https://blog.xamarin.com/installing-xamarin-made-easy-offline-installation/


### Visual Studio on Mac #


0. Install Apple's <strong>XCode</strong> on your Mac's App Store.

   NOTE: Each version is related to a specific version of the Apple OS Mac operating system.

   Know the version by clicking on the program name next to the Apple icon, 
   then select "About":

   ![xcode about 271x48](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/21987451/dc44154a-dbc0-11e6-90b6-4dce91b8c5d2.png)

   At the time of writing, my pop-up shows "Version 8.1 (8B62)".

   XCode 7 supports iOS 9.


   PROTIP: Although Xamarin Studio is currently offered,
   its functonality is being folded into 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/">
   Visual Studio 2017 for Mac</a>, free in Preview until May 31, 2017.

   I predict in the future this will become a paid Visual Studio Enterprise for Mac.

0. Click to download <strong>VisualStudioforMacPreviewInstaller.dmg</strong>,
   22.8 MB.

0. Skip to follow <a href="#MacInstall">these same instructions</a>.

Files installed:

   ~/.local/share/Xamarin 
   
   ~/Library/XAP   ?
   
   ~/Library/Developer/Xamarin 

   ~/Library/Xamarin.Mac contains a License file

   ~/Library/Xamarin* folders /Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes (iOS simulators)


### Xamarin Studio on Mac #


0. Click on the "Download Now" on this page.

0. During VS installation, under 
   <strong>Cross Platform Mobile Development</strong>,
   choose <strong>Custom</strong> and
   select feature <strong>C#/.NET (Xamarin) [3rd Party]</strong>.

   <!-- If you already have VS installed, go to the Control Panel 
   and change the features. -->

0. PROTIP: Before you begin, make sure you have enough disk space.
   The whole install will be shown as near 3 GB (2.2 GB they say).

0. PROTIP: Since different versions of installers have the same name,
   XamarinInstaller.dmg, change the name downloaded with a date such as
   
   <pre>XamarinInstaller_2016.10.24.dmg</pre> takes 22.2 MB according to my Finder.

0. Double-click on it in your Downloads folder to expand.

   <a name="MacInstall"></a>

   ### Mac instructions #

0. Double-click the big down-arrow orange icon to open another window.
   If you don't see the new window press command+tab and tab to the orange icon.

0. Check the checkbox and click Accept.

0. Click on Dependencies and unselect the <strong>components</strong> you don't want, then
   click Continue.

   ![xamarin 6 1 1 install 525x176](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/21961331/5925261a-dac4-11e6-97f7-3a17216bdeb7.png)

   Notice the disk space usage (242 MB) and path (with "mac" subsituted for your account name):

   <tt><strong>
   /Users/mac/Library/Developer/Xamarin/android-sdk-macosx
   </strong></tt>

0. Click Continue.
0. Click Install.
0. Check "I agree" to the Licenses, then Continue.

   PROTIP: You'll be prompted several times to enter your Mac user's password.
   So don't walk off.

0. Visit the <a href="#WhileWaiting">While Waiting</a> section, then return here.

0. When "Installation successful" appears, 
   click "Quit" or "Start" to invoke Visual Studio Community app.

   <img alt="xamarin icon 412x386" width="100" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/21965941/f8fd7e46-db26-11e6-8c7f-560aeb1bdcb1.png">

0. When Xamarin Studio opens (as "community"), click Login.
0. After Login, "Enterprise" should appear at the upper left corner.




### Visual Studio on Windows #

   Those developing on Windows machines work on iPhone by
   running a remote session on a Mac through a cable and running SSH.

   NOTE: Since mobile devices will need to use virtualization,
   the IDE can't also be running in a virtualized environment such as
   VMWare Fusion.

   NOTE: Installation includes 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://university.xamarin.com/lightninglectures/xamarin-mac-agent">
   Xamarin Mac Agent</a> (previously called the Xamarin Build Host).
   Its use includes enabling Remote Login on the Mac
   on the same Network subnet with the Mac's IP address.


   There is a free "Community" edition of Visual Studio on Windows.
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.xamarin.com/compare-visual-studio/">
   But the Community edition doesn't include support</a>.

0. Go to<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.xamarin.com/download/">
   https://www.xamarin.com/download</a>.

0. Create an account or SignIn.

   PROTIP: Many open several accounts for this to get around 
   Microsoft's 30-day trial limits plus 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://store.xamarin.com/account/my/subscription/redeemextension">
   redeeming</a> a 30 day extension approval.

   Your picture appears from your email based on 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gravatar.com/">
   Gravatar.com</a>.

0. Select Product and Xamarin Platform.
   Click "Download now for free".

   It recognizes what operating system you're using 
   based on what browser you used to visit the site.

0. Fill out the form to begin downloading.

0. Obtain a VS 2015 Community Edition web
   installer from https://visualstudio.com.

0. Run the downloader and it downloads the rest.

0. From your Installer folder, invoke the downloaded file.

   Visit the <a href="#WhileWaiting">While waiting</a> section
   if you are not installing on a Mac.



<a name="WhileWaiting"></a>

## Homebrew Mono #

<a target="_blank" href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=xamarin">
In StackOverflow</a> 
are several complaints about brew issues.

0. Rather than manually download the installer from 
   https://xamarin.com,
   installing mono-mdk instead of mono from homebrew.

   ```
   brew cask install mono-mdk
   ```

   https://github.com/xamarin/Homebrew-Formulas
   provides a Tap for Xamarin-specific Homebrew formulas


You can also modify your PATH to use mono-mdk's binary:

export PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/Commands:$PATH

### Clean up disk

0. PROTIP: In Finder, alt-click the XamarinInstaller .dmg file
   to move it to Trash. In the left menu eject the "Xamarin Installer".
   Also clean out your Trash can to recover disk space.

0. PROTIP: If you're going to be using it a lot:
   draw 3 fingers together on the touchpad. Click "X" for Xamarin.

   You'll see "Xamarin Studio", Xamarin Profile, and Xamarin Workbooks.

0. Drag and drop the Xamarin Studio icon to the bar at the bottom of the screen.

The above only needs to be done once per machine.

## Developer Certification

   PROTIP: Learning a platform is a rather big career decision.
   Few people have time to be expert in tools for several languages.
   The fragmentation in Java and Android tools makes it difficult to be quickly productive when moving jobs
   since there are so many variations of tools to master.
   Even though Microsoft does limit and change (abandon) technologies over time,
   their ecosystem offers more focused training resources and help for learners make it easier to master
   and provides better movement among employers. My two cents.

<img align="right" alt="xamarin-certified-developer logo" width="120" height="120" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/23631541/22148710/a84dc842-dedd-11e6-848d-702be87e0d71.png">

PROTIP: You can skip 7 of the 
15 classes Microsoft requires before allowing registriation for certification
if you can answer 80% or more of the 50-questions in the Introductory Assessment Exam 
on <a href="#CSharp">C#</a>. You only get one chance to do it, though.

Email: training@xamarin.com

WARNING: The current certification questions are based mostly on Xamarin.Forms.

   Introduction to Cross-Platform Mobile Development [XAM110]</a>
   One of the advantages to using Xamarin over the traditional platform-specific approach is the level of code-sharing you can achieve across iOS, Android and Windows Phone. In this class, we will explore two ways to structure your shared code - Portable Class Libraries (PCLs) and Shared Asset Projects (SAPs). We will look at the pros and cons of each approach and ways of providing access to platform-specific features in each model.

0. <a target="_blank" href="https://university.xamarin.com/videos/xam120-intro-to-xamarinforms">
   Intro to Xamarin.Forms [XAM120]</a>
   is an introduction to the Xamarin.Forms cross-platform UI framework. In this session you will learn how to create applications for iOS, Android and Windows Phone 8 and share the code for both the UI and the logic that drives it. We will cover the project structure, layout system, basic controls and different app styles you can create.

0. <a target="_blank" href="https://university.xamarin.com/videos/xam130-xaml-in-xamarinforms">
   XAML in Xamarin.Forms [XAM130]</a>
   You can create your UI for Xamarin.Forms applications in code, but another supported approach is to create the UI declaratively using XAML. In this class we will explore the XAML support in Xamarin.Forms, how to add pages, provide behavior and even change property values in a device-specific fashion.

0. <a target="_blank" href="https://university.xamarin.com/videos/layout-in-xamarinforms-xam135">
   Layout in Xamarin.Forms [XAM135]</a>
   Understanding how layout containers work in Xamarin.Forms is key to crafting UI that looks and behaves the way you expect it to in different orientations, devices and sizes. This class will explore how the Xamarin.Forms layout system works and show you how to best utilize the StackLayout and Grid layout containers.

0. <a target="_blank" href="https://university.xamarin.com/videos/xam140-resources-and-styles">
   Resources and Styles in Xamarin.Forms [XAM140]</a>
   This course shows you how to use XAML based resources to eliminate repeated property values. You will remove hard-coded values for things like fonts and colors and define them as resources so you have a single copy that is easy to update. You will also consolidate groups of property values into styles which you will apply to a control as a single unit. This makes it much easier to create a consistent UI across your app.

0. <a target="_blank" href="https://university.xamarin.com/videos/xam150-cross-platform-web-services">
   Consuming REST-based Web Services [XAM150]</a>
   examines how to integrate with and consume RESTful web services in mobile applications. It covers techniques to monitor the network status of the device, a quick introduction to the tenets of REST architecture, and how to properly retrieve, insert, update and delete information from a REST-based service using the cross-platform HttpClient class. Finally, we will look at optimizing our network access by integrating more tightly with the platform-specific network stack.

   QUESTION: GraphQL?

0. <a target="_blank" href="https://university.xamarin.com/videos/xam151-consuming-soap-based-web-services">
   Consuming SOAP-based Web Services [XAM151]</a>
   by Adrian Stevens
   examines how to integrate with and consume SOAP-based web services in Xamarin applications. It covers the basics of SOAP architecture, construction of a proxy client using the WSDL endpoint, and handling asynchronous method calls. WCF (Windows Communications Foundations) is Microsoft's branch name for SOAP.
   This "legacy" protocol is still being used in many systems,
   but new systems now use REST or GraphQL.

0. <a target="_blank" href="https://university.xamarin.com/videos/xam160-data-in-mobile">
   Working with SQLite and Mobile Data [XAM160]</a>
   This class explores how to use SQLite and the SQLite-Net ORM to manage local data in your Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android and Windows applications.

<a name="IDEIntro"></a>

## IDE intro with sample app #

PROTIP: By default, macOS only allows one instance of an application to run. 
To launch a second instance, from a Terminal window: 

   <pre>
   open -n /Applications/Xamarin Studio
   </pre>

   Alternately, launch a new instance use Jonathan Dick's
   <a target="_blank" href="http://redth.codes/xamarin-studio-launcher/">
   http://redth.codes/xamarin-studio-launcher</a>
   convenient app.


0. When Visual Studio or Xamarin Studio is opened and Logged in,
   it presents its <strong>Welcome page</strong>.

0. PROTIP: Return to the Welcome page anytime from the Windows menu.

   The IDE has 3 vertical panes. One pane displays links to news items.
   Another pane has links to tutorials such as
   <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/">
   Learn about Mobile Development with Xamarin</a>.

   PROTIP: Let's begin by looking at Solution is.


   ### New solution templates

0. Click on File | New Solution or press Shift+command+N,
   which presents the various types of solution templates.

   ![vs2017 template 400x172](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/22003489/41ec9782-dc11-11e6-9f83-959cedb7f9ef.png)

   The default is a Multiplatform Xamarin.Forms Forms app.

   All coding is in C# or F#. No VB, C++, etc.

   "Connected" apps are also called "ASP.NET Core" mobile services apps.

   Multiplatform games are created with either SpriteKit or SceneKit.

0. Click the left pane's iOS App to see that Metal and OpenGL game templates are selected there.

   For iOS under the General category are templates specific to iOS, such as
   Single View, etc.

0. Click the left pane's Android App to see templates for Android,
   such as Wear and WebView (hybrid) apps.

0. Scroll down the bottom of the left pane to see the "Other" solutions 
   traditionally supported by Visual Studio:
   .NET and ASP.NET.

   PROTIP: Now let's look at some pre-built apps.

0. Press Esc key to dismiss the dialog.

   Let's now get an understanding of coding by looking at the 
   <a href="PreBuilts">pre-built apps downloaded</a>.
   for Forms apps.


   ### Development approaches

   PROTIP: The types of development approaches:

   * Silo approach of writing Objective-C code for iOS and Java code for Android provided by vendors.
   This requires different developer teams.

   * Black Box takes a single (HTML/JavaScript) code base to create multiple apps with 
   "minimum common" features common across the platforms.

   * Xamarin Forms 

   Xamarin Forms is simpler to program, but you might run into a "brick wall"
   when you need to re-code using the native coding approach.
   But if you can live with eventual limitations,
   Forms is a quick way to get to an app quickly.


   ### XWeather sample app

0. In Finder, navigate into a folder containing app source.

   PROTIP: Open Visual Studio by clicking on a <strong>.sln</strong> (solution) file
   in a folder containing its other files.

0. In Finder, navigate into the XWeather sample app to where the
   <strong>XWeather.sln</strong> (solution) file is listed.

0. Open Visual Studio by clicking on the .sln file.


   ### Structure of folders and files

   After an analysis of various examples, XWeather has what I think the most comprehensible structure for
   folders and files. Here's the tree from root of the app folder:

   * .gitignore
   * images/____.png for the app's sample UI image for display in the store
   * README.md
   * LICENSE.md
   * XWeather folder

   Within the XWeather (alphabetically):
   Code for .Droid and .iOS are generated automatically.

   * Droid = generated for Android devices
   * iOS = generated for Apple iOS devices

      PROTIP: It's better for reuse to not include the name of the app ("Droid" instead of "XWeather.Droid").

   * NuGet.config
   * Scripts
   * Shared
   * UITests
   * Unified
   * ____.sln = solution file for use by Visual Studio IDE
   <br /><br />

   PROTIP: Xamarin Studio stores projects using the Visual Studio .sln file format.
   So solution files are interchangeable between Xamarin Studio and Visual Studio regardless of IDE used.

   There are lots of files in each folder above.


   ### More sample app source

   ### References

   Within VS2017, the References folder within both Android and iOS projects contains:

   * System
   * System.Core
   * System.Xml
   <br /><br />

   Microsoft's .NET Base Class Library (BCL).

   In iOS projects the References folder also contains:

   * Xamarin.iOS
   <br /><br />
   
   In Android projects the References folder also contains:

   * Mono.Android
   <br /><br />
   

   ### Build and Error Review

0. Click the <strong>Build</strong> arrow icon at the top.



   The result is likely errors.   

0. Double-click on the red message for a list at the bottom of the screen.

0. Cursor to the top edge of the message pane so the cursor changes,
   then drag it up to see more lines.

   If there are no blocking errors, you'll see a message such as this:

   NOTES:

   The build process creates IL (Intermediate Language) code that is vendor neutral.
   IL code is defined by the .NET standards by ECMA (not ISO).

   Xmarin.iOS builds use AOT (Ahead of Time Compilation) to compile IL 
   into native ARM assembly code for compile into a native binary executable.

   Xamarin.Android builds use JIT (Just in Time Compilation) 
   to compiles IL into ___ and IPK executable loaded on Android devices.


   A UWP (Universal Windows Program) app runs on both Windows 10 and Windows 10 mobile without rework.
   It's not for Macs.


### New Library Project

Libraries are defined as separate projects.

0. Right-click on the Solution node and select Add > Add a New Project.

0. Under the Multiplatform category, select Library, then Shared Project in the right pane.
   Click Next.

0. Name the project "MyTunes.Shared" and click Create to create the project.

   SAPs are files named <strong>.shproj</strong>
   containing a group of source and assets referenced by each target project's code as if they were 
   individually added to the project, before build.

0. Click Create for template code to be created in a .cs (C#) file.


<a name="CompilerSymbols"></a>

### Solution compiler symbols and directives

0. In the solution pane, double-click on the solution's name (such as XWeather).<br />
   for the Options dialog.

0. In the solution pane, right-click on project name XWeather.Droid.<br />
   Select Compiler.

   Field <strong>Define Symbols</strong> should contain:

   <pre>DEBUG;__ANDROID__;</pre>

   Such values are referenced by conditional compiler directives (shown below).

   Press Esc.

0. In the solution pane, right-click on project name XWeather.iOS.<br />
   Select Compiler.

   Field <strong>Define Symbols</strong> should contain:

   <pre>__UNIFIED__;__MOBILE__;__IOS__;DEBUG;ENABLE_TEST_CLOUD;</pre>

   Notice these values are for the <strong>Configuration:</strong> value
   at the top of the dialog. That's why the value "DEBUG" is there.

0. Click and hold on the value to Configuration: field and select <strong>Release</strong>.

   Field <strong>Define Symbols</strong> should now contain:

   <pre>__UNIFIED__;__MOBILE__;__IOS__;</pre>

0. Press Esc to cancel the dialog.


### Shared Asset Projects (SAPs)

   SAPs were introduced with Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 (April 2014) and Xamarin 5.
   
   Conditional compiler directives in the Shared code
   can direct the compiler to isolate platform-specific code based on 
   <a href="#CompilerSymbols">compiler symbols defined</a>
   defined in

   <pre>
   #if   __IOS__
       ...
   #elif __ANDROID__
       ...
   #elif WINDOWS_PHONE || WINDOWS_UWP
       ...
   #endif
   </pre>

   PROTIP: IOS is listed at the top because that is currently the most popular device type.

   PROTIP: In the code above, there is vertical alignment.

   An alternative is to make calls to a class that is defined in all platforms using 
   the same signature (number of parameters and data types referenced in the call).
   This is called "Class Mirroring".

   The C# language provides for <strong>partial classes and Methods</strong>
   to be defined for code generators to complete.

   SAPs replace PCLs


### PCLs (Platform Class Libraries)

   * View assemblies within a Profile at C:\Program Files (x86)\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework\.NETPortable\v4.5\Profile\Profile78\ 

   * TOOL: <a target="_blank" href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/1177943e-cfb7-4822-a8a6-e56c7905292b">
   .NET Portability Analyzer</a>
   assesses whether an existing library can be converted to a PCL profile.

### Xamarin Components Store

   This applies to both Android and iOS projects.

0. In VS2017 a solution pane under a project, click <strong>Components</strong>.

0. Click the <strong>Open Component Store</strong> button at the bottom of the screen.

0. Sign-In using your Xamarin credentials because
   the Xamarin Component Store was created before NuGet to provide 
   <em>paid</em> support on components (to encourage contributions).

   Among Plugins, https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/Xamarin.Plugins
   enables functionality needed for apps such as for Uber ride sharing.

0. Click Order By: DOWNLOADS to see what people actually use.

   QUESTION: Is there source for a buildable sample app that incorporates these?

   WARNING: Even though there are hundreds of forks,
   if there are no Issues and Pull Requests for a repo,
   there is no real community collaboration, which
   means software that is not really mature.

   * Android Support Library for backward compatitibility
   * Android Support Design Library

   * AdvexpSettings for cross-platform settings, from among Libraries.

   * Xamarin.Auth by Auth0 for 2-factor authentication
   * Xamarin.Social for Facebook, Flickr, Twitter

0. Click on the Website link for a component, such as Action Pack.

   WARNING: If the "Published On" date is more than a year ago, it may be that the component
   is not really supported anymore.

   NOTE: Many components are published in both the Component Store and 
   Microsoft's <strong>NuGet.org</strong>.

0. Press Esc to return to the IDE.


   ### Xamarin Packages

0. Click <strong>Packages</strong> on the solution pane.

   An Add Packages dialog appears.

0. Click and hold on Nuget.org.   

   You can configure additional sources of components, such as .NetFoundation.org.

0. Click Close.


   ### Additional Components

   When a Xamarin component is installed into an App project, it is placed in a 
   Components folder at the root level of the Solution folder. If you remove the Component from all projects in the solution, it will get removed from this folder as well. A copy is ALSO stored in a cache:

   On Windows: %LocalAppData%\Xamarin\Cache\Components

   On Mac: ~/Library/Caches/Xamarin/Components

   PROTIP: To remove a component completely from a machine, 
   delete it from your projects/solutions 
   AND from the cache folder.

   QUESTION: Code used across different platforms are stored in different "profiles".


   ### Assets

   DEFINITION: Assets include text and font files loaded by Android code such as:

   <pre>
   Typeface tf = Typeface.CreateFromAsset (Context.Assets, "fonts/samplefont.ttf");
   </pre>

   The above code calls methods in Android's AssetManager package.

   https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/getting-started/

   "Xamarin.Forms is a new library that enables you to build native UIs for iOS, Android and Windows Phone from a single, shared C# codebase. It provides more than 40 cross-platform controls and layouts which are mapped to native controls at runtime, which means that your user interfaces are fully native."

   UI controls are coded at a high level in C# for the library to render them as native counterparts
   in each platform.

   Xamarin.Forms controls are a wrapper on native controls, they aren't new controls themselves.

   v4 introduced a new SSH-based build host which replaces the old and buggy build host. 
   
   v3 introduced Xamarin.Forms supports Native UI development for iOS, Android, and Windows.

### UI


   ## Profiles

   Code used across different platforms are stored in different "profiles".


   ### Plug-ins for Xamarin Forms #

   Gaps in Xamarin Forms functionality are filled by
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jamesmontemagno">
   https://github.com/jamesmontemagno</a> 
   James Montemagno (@JamesMontemagno),
   Principal Program Manager for @Xamarin at Microsoft.

   * https://github.com/XLabs/Xamarin-Forms-Labs
   XLabs (no longer maintained) 
   was an open source project to provide a powerful and cross platform set of 
   services and controls tailored to work with Xamarin and Xamarin Forms.


   <a name="FancyControls"></a>

   ### Fancier Controls #

   PROTIP: If you want fancier UI and have $1000,
   consider the Infragistics Xamarin Forms library at
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.infragistics.com/products/xamarin-forms">
   http://www.infragistics.com/products/xamarin-forms</a>

   This is coded in a similar way and look similar as on other platforms.
   So it's good to keep up.



### Debugger

   "SE" is the emulator.

To run on a physical iOS device:

   * Have a registered Apple Developer account.

   * Get a Code Signing Certificate from Apple


### MVVM (Model - View - ViewModel)

   MVVM (pronounced by spelling out the letters Em Vee Vee Em)
   is a layered, separated presentation pattern made popular
   by XAML based UI where a data binding engine takes the place of the controller/presenter.
   
   Models (entities consisting of classes and methods) are shared across platforms.

   Views are visual aspects of what is presented to users to see and interact with (layouts, colors, fonts, buttons).

   ViewModels are a view-centric representation of the data to be displayed
   (the strings for each element)

   In the <a target="_blank" href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/XamarinShow">
   Xamarin Show</a>
   <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.xamarin.com/the-xamarin-show-getting-started-with-mvvm/">
   on MVVM</a>, James Montemagno explains how,
   conceptually, MVVM enables developers to separate business logic from user interface code.

   Mono's UI is developed using XAML (pronounced Zam-mil).
   XAML is a variant of XML containing definitions of UI elements,
   much like Android XML. (iOS Storyboards)

   The XAML is referenced by "code behind" programming code that define behaviors.

   The code sets text properties, register for click handlers, and 
   automatically enable and disable controls with Commands.

   The data binding framework built into Xamarin.Forms.

   The programming language is Microsoft's <strong>C# version 6.0</strong>.

   Building an Azure Mobile App Client [AZR115]</a>
   This class focuses on the client-side model for building a Xamarin application that uses an Azure App Service mobile back-end. We will explore the techniques used to add support to an existing Xamarin application to consume data from an Azure service, how to support offline caching and synchronization, and how to manage conflicts when they arise.

   Authentication with Azure [AZR120]</a>
   This class begins with how to activate the built-in authentication services in Azure by configuring an identity provider. We then show you how to log in and out of the identity provider from your Xamarin mobile applications. Finally, we dive into how to restrict your data to a specific user by utilizing the authentication information returned from the identity provider.
