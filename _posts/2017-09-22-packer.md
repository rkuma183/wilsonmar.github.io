This tutorial contains hands-on <strong>step-by-step</strong> instructions for "newbies" to create a Windows 2016 server within a Mac laptop (the host machine).

![docker-build-2017-09-21b-650x250-41561](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30707794-79a06b1e-9eb1-11e7-8e75-337a13f034c2.jpg)

The workflow begins from "scratch" with an ISO file (like on a DVD) from Microsoft. Microsoft requires registration. We download Stefan's repo from GitHub, which has a Packer script that uses the iso file to create a VMware Fusion server image running on MacOS. VMware is needed for nested virtualization of Windows HyperV containers. After applying Windows Update, the VMware image is converted to a Vagrant box image. Based on Hashicorp's VMWare-vagrant provider and the Vagrantfile, a Windows server is instantiated. We RDP into the Vagrant box to install and configure Windows apps. 

This Windows server can be used as the host to create Dockerized images such as <a href="#WinContainers">Windows Docker Containers</a>. The images are pushed up to DockerHub so others can use it to run as isolated on each Windows server machine in production.

1. Be inside a Terminal window, on any directory.
0. [Install Homebrew](/macos-homebrew/)
0. Install a Git client.
0. ssh.exe or putty for Windows.

   ### VMWare

   Install VMware Fusion 8.5 for Mac (not the Pro edition) for its drivers.

0. Pay $395 for the license after 10 days.
0. Get the installer from:

   https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/fusion-evaluation.html

   VMware-Fusion-8.5.8-5824040.dmg is 467 MB.

0. Double-click on the file downloaded to run the installer.
0. Exit the pop-up by clicking the "X" at the upper-left.
0. In Finder, scroll to the "Drives" section on the left pane to click the exit icon to the right of "VMware Fusion".
0. Right-click the .dmg and "Move to Trash".

   PROTIP: There is no need to invoke the program from Applications folder (/Applications/VMware Fusion.app).

   ### Vagrant install

0. Install Vagrant using Homebrew:

   <tt><strong>
export HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS="--appdir=/Applications"
brew cask install vagrant
   </strong></tt>

0. To avoid <a target="_blank" href="https://communities.vmware.com/thread/543980">issues</a>, delete the curl program from Vagrant so your Mac's program is used:

   <tt><strong>sudo rm /opt/vagrant/embedded/bin/curl
    </strong></tt>



   ### All Vagrant commands

0. List Vagrant commands:

   <pre><strong>

   </pre>

   ### Vagrant VMware install

0. Install the Vagrant Fusion plugin from Hashicorp:

   <tt><strong>
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vmware-fusion     
   </strong></tt>

   The response at time of writing:

   <pre>
Installing the 'vagrant-vmware-fusion' plugin. This can take a few minutes...
Fetching: vagrant-share-1.1.9.gem (100%)
Fetching: vagrant-vmware-fusion-4.0.24.gem (100%)

Installing license for 'vagrant-vmware-fusion'...
The license for 'vagrant-vmware-fusion' was successfully installed!
   </pre>

   QUESTION: What is the name of the provider to use?


   <a name="Packer"></a>

   ### Packer from GitHub

   Packer (at <a target="_blank" href="https://packer.io/">packer.io</a>) is from Hashicorp who created Vagrant. It is a cross-vendor utility that builds images used by VMware and cloud providers: Amazon EC2, CloudStack, DigitalOcean, Docker, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure, QEMU, VirtualBox.

0. Install Packer using Homebrew:

   <tt><strong>brew install packer
   </strong></tt>

0. Create a folder to house various repositories from GitHub:

   <pre><strong>
cd ~
mkdir gits
cd gits
   </strong></pre>

   Alternately, some prefer `dev`.

0. Create a folder to house repositories around a subject, such as virtual machines:

   <pre><strong>
cd ~/gits
mkdir vms
cd vms
   </strong></pre>

   Alternately, use your own "subject" folder.

0. Get the Packer scripts (just the latest version):

   <pre><strong>
git clone https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows --depth=1
cd packer-windows 
   </strong></pre>

   Sample response:

   <pre>
Cloning into 'packer-windows'...
remote: Counting objects: 167, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (133/133), done.
remote: Total 167 (delta 42), reused 93 (delta 11), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (167/167), 130.58 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (42/42), done.
   </pre>

0. Use a text editor to view file `windows_2016_docker.json`.

   The sections are "builder", "provisioners", "Post-processors", and "variables".

   The "iso_url" variable defines the URL to get the Windows 2016 disk image.

   WARNING: The URL changes over time.


   ### Register for Windows ISO file

0. Get to the page providing downloads of Windows Server 2016 Evaluation edition good for 180 days:

   https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2016/

   We come to this page to get a cookie for a Packer script to download.

0. Click Register, and provide your info.
0. Select "ISO" (not Azure or Virtua Lab). Click Continue.
0. Select "English". Click Download.
0. Cancel the download of file:

   14393.0.161119-1705.RS1_REFRESH_SERVER_EVAL_X64FRE_EN-US.iso

   Leave it to the Packer to download the file, but we want to make sure that it downloads the most recent file Microsoft has.

   PROTIP: The file at time of writing is a whopping <strong>6.5 GB</strong>! 
   So it may take hours to download, depending on how fast your internet connection is.


   ### Packer pulls the installer and runs it

0. While in the packer-windows folder, use the Packer file <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows/blob/my/windows_2016_docker.json">windows_2016_docker.json</a> in the repo from Stefan:

   <tt><strong>
packer build \-\-only=vmware-iso windows_2016_docker.json 
   </strong></tt>

   This downloads the .iso file from Microsoft. Note one of the response lines from it:

   <pre>
vmware-iso: Downloading or copying: http://care.dlservice.microsoft.com/dl/download/1/4/9/149D5452-9B29-4274-B6B3-5361DBDA30BC/14393.0.161119-1705.RS1_REFRESH_SERVER_EVAL_X64FRE_EN-US.ISO
   </pre>

   Packer stores the installer into a folder named "packer_cache". 
   So to run using what has already been downloaded:

   <tt><strong>
packer build \-\-only=vmware-iso windows_2016_docker.json 
\-\-var iso_url=~/gits/vms/packer-windows/packer_cache/49f719e23c56a779a991c4b4ad1680b8363918cd0bfd9ac6b52697d78a309855.iso
   </strong></tt>

   NOTE: This is also MSDN file en_windows_server_2016_x64_dvd_9718492.iso

   PROTIP: The Packer command can be restarted and it restarts where it left off on partial downloads. 
   Once downloaded, it knows to not download again.

   The rest of the response:

   <pre>
    vmware-iso: Download progress: 100%
==> vmware-iso: Creating floppy disk...
    vmware-iso: Copying files flatly from floppy_files
    vmware-iso: Copying file: ./answer_files/2016/Autounattend.xml

    vmware-iso: Done copying paths from floppy_dirs
==> vmware-iso: Creating virtual machine disk
==> vmware-iso: Building and writing VMX file
==> vmware-iso: Starting virtual machine...
   </pre>

   ### VMware Fusion Internal Error

   On occassion, my VMware Fusion 8.5 displays "Internal error" upon starting an image.

   <pre>
==> vmware-iso: Error starting VM: VMware error: Error: Cannot connect to the virtual machine
==> vmware-iso: Deleting output directory...
Build 'vmware-iso' errored: Error starting VM: VMware error: Error: Cannot connect to the virtual machine
&nbsp;
==> Some builds didn't complete successfully and had errors:
--> vmware-iso: Error starting VM: VMware error: Error: Cannot connect to the virtual machine
&nbsp;
==> Builds finished but no artifacts were created.
   </pre>

   PROTIP: The Packer command can be restarted and it restarts where it left off


   ### Windows Desktop Update

   Packer shows this message while it constructs a Windows instance:

   <pre>
==> vmware-iso: Waiting for WinRM to become available...
   </pre>

   A cmd.exe window appears to display messages about the Update process, which can take a while.

   <pre>
Checking for Windows Updates
Script: A:\win-updates.ps1
Script User: VAGRANT-2016\vagrant
Started: 9/18/2017 12:30:58 AM
   </pre>

   We wait (with no countdown UI) while this appears:

   <pre>
Downloading updates...
   </pre>

   WARNING: If Windows Update is interrupted, Packer will start again with a new instance of VMware Fusion image, and download again.

   TODO: Contact them and see if we can avoid re-downloading.

0. PROTIP: Keep your laptop plugged into a power source and a (preferrably fast) network.

0. PROTIP: Keep the MacOS screen from going to sleep: choose Apple menu > System Preferences, click Energy Saver.
   Drag the "Display sleep" to "Never".

   PROTIP: To move mouse beyond the Windows machine, press command+Tab until the process you want is highlighted.

   The <strong>WindowsServer2016Docker.vmx</strong> file that VMware Fusion opens is created inside the <strong>output-vmware-iso</strong> folder. However, this folder is <strong>moved</strong> to:

   `~/.vagrant.d/boxes/windows_2016_docker/0/vmaware_desktop/WindowsServer2016Docker.vmx`

   when you see:

   <pre>
Build 'vmware-iso' finished.
==> Build finished. The artifacts of successful builds are:
--> vmware-iso: 'vmware' provider box: windows_2016_docker_vmware.box
   </pre>

   The .box file is created in the GitHub root level directory. 

   Custom applications are added within the Vagrant image, not in the .vmx image.
