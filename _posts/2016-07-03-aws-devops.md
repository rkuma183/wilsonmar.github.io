This tutorial describes information to get certified as a <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-devops-engineer-professional/">
AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional</a>,

It costs $300 USD to <strong>write out</strong> 80 essay (not multiple-choice) questions in 170 minutes (with no breaks). <strong>That's 2.1 seconds per question.</strong>
Those who fail the exam must wait 30 days before being allowed to retake the exam,
and only 3 times in a 12 month period.

Its pre-requisite is passing either one:

Amazon</a> defines "DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity."

### Setup instances #

0. In IAM Service, create Role "codedeploy".

0. Create CDInstanceRole

0. In Compute EC2 service, launch Amazon Linux, t2.micro, 2 instances, using the role created above.
   In Advanced Details, paste script from https://gist.github.com/mikepfeiffer/4d9386afdcceaf29493a

   EC2 UserData script to install <strong>CodeDeploy agent</strong>:

   <pre>
   #!/bin/bash
   yum install -y aws-cli
   cd /home/ec2-user/
   aws s3 cp 's3://aws-codedeploy-us-east-1/latest/codedeploy-agent.noarch.rpm' . --region us-east-1
   yum -y install codedeploy-agent.noarch.rpm
   </pre>

   CUSTOMIZE folder, region mentionedtwice.

0. Tag instances with name "Dev" for Development.
0. Add a Security Group Role for HTTP. No SSH.

### AWS CodeDeploy Setup #

0. <a target="_blank" href="https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/home?region=us-west-2#/first-run/welcome">
   Got to AWS CodeDeploy service, Get Started Now</a>.
0. Custom deployment.
0. Specify an Application Name and Deployment Group Name according to your organization's naming standards.
0. Select Tag Type "Amazon EC2" value "Dev" specified for 2 instances in a step above.
0. Deployment Config - AllAtOnce (instead of Half at a time).
0. No Triggers.
0. Select a Service Role ARN defined in a prior step. Create Application.

   The Console provides code to deploy from a S3 bucket.

### AWS CodePipeline #

0. <a target="_blank" href="https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/home?region=us-west-2#/create/Name">
  Go to AWS CodePipeline service, Get Started</a>.
0. Specify a Pipeline name according to your organization's naming standards. ("Pipeline1")
0. Select Source Provider: GitHub (NOT Amazon S3). Click Connect to GitHub.
0. Select a Repository and Branch from the GitHub account authenticated.
0. Select Deployment provider AWS CodeDeploy (NOT AWS Elastic Beanstalk).
0. Supply AWS CodeDeploy Application Name and Deployment group from earlier.
0. Do not define Build Stage (until we have a build).
0. Create Service Role using default name "AWS-CodePipeline-Service". View Policy Document to review Actions allowed the role:
0. Review Pipeline summary.

### View app deployed #

0. In EC2, get the Public DNS address (such as "ec2-11-222-177-132-us-west-2-compute.amazonaws.com").
0. Paste URL in an internet browser.

   It should respond with "Congratualations".

### Make Change #

0. Commit.
0. Detect a change.
0. View app deployed again.


0. Create a Deployment Group or Autoscaling Group
0. CodePipeline


0. appspec.yml file in the root folder in source code repo

## Snapshot AMIs #

Building a server from installers in S3
can be time-consuming because it take so much I/O.

Michael Tripoli & Karate Vick at <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@NetflixTechBlog">
Netflix</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Netflix/aminator/">
open-sourced on GitHub</a> their Python tool called "Animator" for creating EBS-backed AMIs.
The tool create a <strong>Base AMI</strong>
by taking a snapshot of the root volume
and making it available as an EBS volume that can be used to launch an EC2 instance.

It's described <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/ami-creation-with-aminator-98d627ca37b0">
on Medium</a> and in <a target="_blank" href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/03/ami-creation-with-aminator.html">
this blog from 2013</a>.

They said "We knew that application startup latency would be very important, especially during scale-up operations."

This is simpler than Packer from Hashicorp.
