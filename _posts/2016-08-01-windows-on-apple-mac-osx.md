There are several ways to run Microsoft Windows on an Apple Mac computer.
Each has its own advantages and disadvantages:

* <a href="#RDP">Remote Desktop Protocol client to Amazon EC2 instances</a>
* <a href="#WorkSpaces">On an internet browser to Amazon WorkSpaces</a>
* <a href="#Docker">Docker Windows instance</a>
* <a href="#BootCamp">BootCamp</a>
* <a href="#VMwareFusion">VMWare Fusion</a>
* <a href="#Parallels">Parallels</a>

<a name="RDP"></a>

## Cloud Instances 

If you have no administrative rights on your corporate Windows laptop, spin up cloud instances in the cloud and access them via a client that uses Microsoft's RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol).

### RDP Clients

These RDP clients can reach into instances of Amazon EC2 or other cloud that house Windows servers.

1. Microsoft Windows operating systems have, within Start Programs > Accessories, a RDP client program. It can be used without being an Administrator.

2. Within Chrome browser, install the <a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-rdp/cbkkbcmdlboombapidmoeolnmdacpkch?hl=en"> $7.99 Chrome browser app</a>. This enables you to run the most powerful of servers from a ChromeBook laptop with minimal RAM and hard disk.


### Cloud Images

The nice thing about this approach is that it's now a commonly used technology.


#### Amazon EC2

A <a target="_blank" href="https://secureanycloud.com/">hardened</a> Amazon Machine Image (AMI) containing Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition on Windows Server 2016 <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B06XKP1YWV">costs 28 cents per hour on a t2.medium in the US</a>. 20 cents of that goes pays for <a target="_blank" href="mailto:Support@SecureAnyCloud.com">support</a> from <a target="_blank" href="https://secureanycloud.com/">Cognosys</a>, its creator. 888.489-2723

   Costs increase in a linear way for more CPUs:
   ![ec2-cognosys-cpu-trend-552x233](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/29998551-5f497366-8feb-11e7-9246-2526d87641d5.jpg)
   <br />
   Costs increase in a linear way for more Memory (RAM):
   ![ec2-cognosys-mem-trend-555x279](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/29998428-ef366ac8-8fe7-11e7-9954-85359f819fbc.jpg)


   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ec2instances.info/">ec2instances.info</a> provides a spreadsheet.

   WARNING: On AWS EC2, Windows Server 2016 Nano servers do not support RDP, only Windows PowerShell.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">A t2.medium has 2 cores and 4 GB</a>.

   PROTIP: With Amazon, you pay for hourly increments. With Google, you pay per minute.



<a target="_blank" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/connecting_to_windows_instance.html">Connect to an instance in AWS EC2</a>:

1. Create an Amazon EC2 account at http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


<a name="WorkSpaces"></a>

### Browser WorkSpaces in AWS cloud

This approach works not just a MacOS laptop, 
but for any computer running a modern browser,
such as <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/userguide/amazon-workspaces-chromebook-client.html">
on a Chromebook</a>. No files are transferred, just graphic
images of a screen on servers within the AWS cloud.
This makes for more stringent security, but also mean significant lag that affect productivity.

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/search.jspa?mbtc=iQylnisvlZwOpRpOlSNPnOsymqDNwqQZ&objID=f164&q=workspaces&x=0&y=0">
   Amazon's Workspaces Forum questions</a>
   <br /><br />

0. In the <a target="_blank" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/home">
   WorkSpaces Console</a> for your default region, Get Started, Launch, and
   Select a Bundle.

   An image contains only the OS, software and settings. A bundle is a combination of both that image and the hardware from which a WorkSpace can be launched.

   The Free Tier provides two Standard bundle WorkSpaces for up to 40 hours of combined use per month, for two calendar months, from the time you create your first WorkSpace. Usage time accrues while youâ€™re actively using your WorkSpace as well as the time it takes to stop after a specified period of inactivity, which by default is set to one hour. If you exceed the Free Tier limits, you will be charged the standard Amazon WorkSpaces hourly rate for the additional resources you use. At the end of two calendar months, the WorkSpaces you launched in the Free Tier will automatically be billed at the applicable hourly rate.

   Amazon's regular <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/workspaces/pricing/">
   pricing is $25 to $75 per month per user</a>, which Amazon estimates is 59% less than traditional Virtual Desktop Infrastructures (VDI) provided by Citrix and VMware.

   Amazon's approach uses newer tech than VDI. 

0. Specify for each user his/her Username, First Name, Last Name, and Email for the Bundle selected.

   PROTIP: Have the Username the same as the Email.

0. Click Launch Workspace for all users. When the Workspace Console goes from PENDING to AVAILABLE (in green letters).

   Return to managed users in the Amazon WorkSpaces Application Manager (WAM) at<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/wam/home">
   https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/wam/home</a> for your current region.

   CAUTION: There is no moving WorkSpaces from one region to another.


   ### Install WorkSpaces client
   
0. In each user's email client, open the welcome email and click the link.
0. Set your WorkSpaces credentials with a password.
0. Highlight the registration code in the email and copy to your Clipboard.
   
0. Choose the link for your laptop model at <br />
   <a target="_blank" href="http://clients.amazonworkspaces.com/">
   http://clients.amazonworkspaces.com</a> 

0. Download and install the Chrome application to enable the proprietary PC over IP (PCoIP) protocol (from Teradici) to compress, encrypt and rapidly transport image pixels between client and server.

   On a MacOS, it's file "WorkSpaces.pkg" (38.2 MB taking 115.3 MB space).

   On a Chromebook, click "ADD TO CHROME" at the upper-right corner.

0. Double-click on the installer and click Continue and
   finally, Install. Provide your password when requested.

0. Move the installer file (WorkSpaces.pkg) to Trash, to recover disk space.
   
0. Do a Chromebook search to verify that the Amazon WorkSpaces client app icon appears.

0. BLAH: The full graphic streaming virtual desktops tends to eat up much bandwidth. So measure how much you have used before and after sessions.

   Optionally, your company's existing on-premises Active Directory (AD) can be reached by Amazon via an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a hardware virtual private network (VPN) connection or a dedicated connection with AWS Direct Connect. 

   Once linked up, you use the  AWS Management Console to select the users in your Active Directory who will receive a WorkSpace. 

0. Open the app for the first time.
0. Type your user name and password and choose Sign In.
0. Paste the registration code and click Register.

   ### Repeat Login

   NOTE: 1Password cannot auto-fill Username and Password on the MacOS WorkSpaces app nor on Chrombook.

0. Login using the Username and password for the WorkSpaces client.

   If your Amazon WorkSpaces administrator has enabled multi-factor authentication for your organization's WorkSpaces, you are prompted for a passcode to complete your login. 

   CAUTION: Only one browser can be used at the same time.
   Amazon logs off a session when another session is started on another computer.

0. If your Amazon WorkSpaces administrator has not disabled the "Remember Me" feature, you are prompted to save your credentials securely so that you can connect to your WorkSpace easily in the future. Your credentials are securely cached while the application is running.

   After the client application connects to your WorkSpace, your WorkSpace desktop is displayed.

0. (Optional) If your WorkSpace uses an AD Connector directory, update the maximum lifetime of the Kerberos ticket by following the steps in Configuring Kerberos Policies in the Microsoft TechNet Library. 

0. If you need to disable the "Remember Me" feature, search for help in the Amazon WorkSpaces forum.

   ### Configure Remote Assistance

0. Open PowerShell window.
0. Install Remote Assistance using this PowerShell command:
  
   <tt><strong>Add-WindowsFeature Remote-Assistance
   <strong></tt>

   Open port 3389 in the firewall and in the Security Group, Remote Desktop should work using the username and password in the traditional way.


   ### Configure Windows 7 Folder Options

0. Click the Windows Start round icon at the bottom left of the screen.
0. Type "folder options" (without the quotes) until the line "Folder Options" appears for you to click at the top of the menu.

0. Click the Windows PowerShell folder.
0. Drag "Windows PowerShell" and drop it on the tool bar at the bottom of the screen.

0. Open Windows Explorer from the tool bar at the bottom of the screen.
0. Click on "Computer". Notice there is no C: drive and no access to C:\Windows internals.
0. Double-Click on "User Profile D:" drive.

   Notice there are 50 GB for you.

0. Double-Click on D: and navigate into folder Users, your account name.

   PROTIP: Here is the default location when command line windows open by default.
   So place scripts here (among folders).

0. Right-Click Windows PowerShell to select "Run as Administrator".
0. Type:

   <tt><strong>echo $Env:USERPROFILE
   </strong></tt>

   This is your user home folder.

0. Set permissions:

   <tt><strong>set-executionpolicy remotesigned
   </strong></tt>

   <pre>
Execution Policy Change
The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing the execution policy might expose
you to the security risks described in the about_Execution_Policies help topic at
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. Do you want to change the execution policy?
[Y] Yes  [N] No  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"): Y
   </pre>

0. Type Y to confirm.
   
   See <a target="_blank" href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb613481.aspx">
   How to write a PowerShell script</a>


0. Within PowerShell you can also go your home by typing:

   <tt><strong>cd ~
   </strong></tt>

0. Verify whether you can create a PowerShell script file:

   <tt><strong>Add-Content helloworld.ps1 'Write-Host "Hello World"'
   </strong></tt>

   This is the PowerShell equivalent of `echo "Hello World" >helloworld.ps1`.

0. List directory:

   <tt><strong>dir
   </strong></tt>

0. Type the first letter h and press Tab to auto-complete:

   <tt><strong>./helloworld.ps1
   </strong></tt>

   Instead of "Hello World", if you get this, it means executionpolicy was not set correctly:

   <pre>
    + CategoryInfo          : SecurityError: (:) [], PSSecurityException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess
   </pre>


   ### Install posh-git for PowerShell

0. As an administrator, in the Console, select the WorkSpace and select "Create Image" to create an image with your applications and settings. 

   NOTE: Custom images created from Amazon WorkSpaces Graphics bundles can only be used with Graphics bundles, and custom images created from Value, Standard, Performance, or Power bundles can only be used with those bundles. Most Amazon WorkSpace images are available within 45 minutes.

   See http://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/workspaces/images


<a name="Docker"></a>

## Docker #

Docker is now a favored approach because it runs the same (unaltered)
[(Dockerized apps)](/dockerize/) on Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms.

Docker provides a transparent interface to operating systems.

* [Docker setup](/docker-setup/)
* [Docker build](/docker-build/)


<a id="BootCamp"></a>

## Boot Camp on Mac #

Apple came up with it, at <a target="_blank" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201468">
https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201468</a>
says the installer is in the <strong>Utilities folder inside the Applications folder</strong>.

This is called a "split brain" approach. The hassle with this are that:

* a repartition of your startup disk to create a Windows partition is necessary.
   You install Windows in the Windows partition.

* <strong>switching requires a reboot</strong>.

See https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201468



## Parallels

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop">Parallels</a>

<a target="_blank" href="http://kb.parallels.com/en/112941">
Parallels Boot Camp Guide</a> and
<a target="_blank" href="http://kb.parallels.com/en/112091"> Guidelines</a>

<a target="_blank" href="https://stormpath.com/blog/ultimate-guide-to-using-visual-studio-on-a-mac">One blogger</a> combined
both: installing Windows into a Boot Camp partition first, and then turned that partition into an active Parallels virtual machine. This way, I have the option of using Windows in the virtual machine, or restarting to run Windows natively at full speed.  But he hasnâ€™t needed to boot directly to Windows.

You canâ€™t pause the virtual machine or save it to a snapshot. A non-Boot Camp virtual machine doesnâ€™t have these limitations.

Virtual machine settings: 
    2 virtual CPUs
    4096MB system memory
    256MB graphics memory

Parallels options:

    * Optimization: Faster virtual machine, Adaptive hypervisor, Tune Windows for speed all turned on.
    * Sharing: Shared cloud, SmartMount, and Access Windows folders from Mac turned off, as I didnâ€™t need these for my workflow.

Parallelsâ€™ Coherence presentation mode shows Windows apps side-by-side with OS X is good for copy and paste. But this slows performance.

PROTIP: Use two monitors. Have Windows full-screen on an external Thunderbolt display, and OS X on the laptop screen. Then swipe the Magic Mouse to switch desktops.

Fix a few annoyances and performance drains:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfjFJ-v_h2s
Web Development in Visual Studio 2017

* Function keys. If youâ€™re using the Mac keyboard, youâ€™ll want to change the function key behavior so the F1-F12 keys work correctly in Visual Studio. From System Preferences â€“ Keyboard, make sure Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys is checked. With this turned on, hold Fn to use the Mac functions (brightness, volume, etc.) on F1-F12. With an external non-Mac keyboard, this isnâ€™t an issue.

* Disable Windows visual effects. I turned off most of the Windows desktop manager visual effects by going to Control Panel â€“ System and Security â€“ Advanced system settings â€“ Advanced â€“ Performance â€“ Settings â€“ Visual Effects and choosing Adjust for best performance. However, I left Smooth edges of screen fonts checked because it improves text rendering on my monitor.

Through trial and error, I found a number of things that could be disabled to improve performance. You may not want to make all of the changes I did, so pick and choose your own list of tweaks:

    Disable hardware-accelerated rendering. Unchecking Automatically adjust visual experience based on client performance, Enable rich client visual experience, and Use hardware graphics acceleration if available via Options â€“ Environment made the UI feel much more responsive on my machine.

    Start up to an empty environment. Starting up Visual Studio for the first time feels a lot snappier if you skip the default news page on startup. Select Empty environment under Options â€“ Environment â€“ Startup â€“ At startup.

    Remove unused extensions. Visual Studio ships with a number of extensions that you may not need. From Tools â€“ Extensions and Updates â€“ Installed, remove any extensions you arenâ€™t actively using (you can always reinstall them later). I got rid of six extensions I didnâ€™t need.

    Disable extra debugging features. I turned off both Enable Diagnostic Tools while debugging and Show elapsed time PerfTip while debugging in Options â€“ Debugging â€“ General. I wasnâ€™t using these debugging features, and debugging felt snappier after I disabled them.

    Turn off the Navigation Bar. I found the code editor Navigation Bar to be unnecessary if the Solution Explorer is open. I disabled it via Options â€“ Text Editor â€“ All Languages â€“ Navigation Bar.

    Disable CodeLens. CodeLens is a cool feature for collaboration, but itâ€™s not part of my current workflow. I got rid of the CPU overhead by turning it off via Options â€“ Text Editor â€“ All
    Languages â€“ CodeLens â€“ Enable CodeLens.

    Turn off Track Changes. When a file is open in the code editor, Visual Studio will represent recent changes by displaying small regions of green or yellow on the scroll bar. If you can live without this, turn off Track changes via Options â€“ Text Editor â€“ General for a small performance boost.

    Turn off Track Active Item. Squeeze out a little bit more UI performance out by ensuring Track Active Item in Solution Explorer is unchecked under Options â€“ Projects and Solutions â€“ General.


<a id="VMwareFusion"></a>

## VMware Fusion #

It costs $395, but you can run quickly switch among Windows or Linux on a MacOSX machine using VMWare Fusion.

This would enable you to experiment with setups.

## USB Drives

Most USB drives are sold formatting in NTFS which Mac can read but not write to.
Windows computers can't even read Mac-formatted HFS+ drives. 

FAT32 has a 4GB size limit per file, so it isn't ideal for video files. 
FAT32 also has 32 GB limit for drives.

<strong>exFAT</strong> has a theoritical limit of 16 Exa-bytes. 64 ZB (512 TB recommended max).
Format the USB drive in "exFAT" format and it can be read by both Windows and Mac (except for Leopard version of Macs, which few Mac users have anymore).
<a target="_blank" href="http://superuser.com/questions/257646/why-should-i-use-exfat-over-ntfs-on-removable-media">This blog</a> says it's faster than NTFS.

To format extFAT on a Mac UI:

1. Connect the drive to the Mac.
2. Open Disk Utility: hit command and spacebar at the same time for Spotlight search, then type in Disk Utility to find the program.
3. Select the USB drive you want to format. (The lowest level with an eject icon under an "External").
4. Click Erase.
5. Give the partition a name and select exFAT for the format.
6. Click Erase again.

If you get an error message "Erase process has failed", open a Terminal to use commands:

0. Get the disk id from:

   <pre>
diskutil list
   </pre>

0. unmount using the disk ID from above:

   <pre>
diskutil unmountDisk force disk3
   </pre>

   The response is

   Forced unmount of all volumes on disk3 was successful

0. Write zeros

   <pre>
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk3 bs=1024 count=1024
   </pre>

   The response:

   <pre>
1024+0 records in
1024+0 records out
1048576 bytes transferred in 1.889696 secs (554891 bytes/sec)
   </pre>   

0. partition it again in "MBR" partition scheme for use with Windows machines:

   <pre>
diskutil partitionDisk disk3 1 MBR exfat MyDisk 100%
   </pre>

   "Error creating partition map: The disk is too large to be supported by the given partition scheme (-69659)"

   Windows 7 doesn't like the UUID partition scheme. Reformat as MBR in OSX for Win7

   This is why if you format exFAT on a Mac, it won't read on a PC.
   But if you format exFAT on a PC, the it will work on both.

   Alternately, to partition it in "Mac OS Extended (Journaled)" format
   so a Mac can boot from it:

   <pre>
diskutil partitionDisk disk3 GPT JHFS+ "My External HD" 0g
   </pre>

   See http://www.theinstructional.com/guides/disk-management-from-the-command-line-part-2

   The response:

   <pre>

   2:                  Apple_HFS My External HD          3.0 TB     disk3s2
   </pre>

0. Repeat the steps above for ExFAT.

Click on the Partition tab in the DU main window.
 
3. Under the Volume Scheme heading set the number of partitions from the drop down menu to one. 
Click on the Options button, set the partition scheme to MBR then click on the OK button. 
Set the format type to MSDOS (FAT32.) Click on the Partition button and wait until the process has completed.

See https://support.apple.com/kb/PH22240?locale=en_US

Alternately:

0. brew install e2fsprogs
0. figure out the name of your partition or drive using diskutil list -- in my case, my partition had was on disk2 and had the identifier of disk3s2

0. ?

   sudo $(brew --prefix e2fsprogs)/sbin/mkfs.ext3 /dev/disk3s2 

   but you may need to change the drive from disk2s1 to the partition or drive that you want to format. This command will ask you to verify the name of the partition, just to be sure :)


## Format ExFAT on Windows OS

1. Open up Windows Explorer and right-click on your drive in the sidebar. Choose "Format".
2. In the "File System" dropdown, choose exFAT instead of NTFS.
3. Click Start and close this window when finished.

To press F keys (F2, etc.), hold down the fn key and press F2, etc.
at the top row.

### Settings

Several topics below refer to use of VMWare Tools installed from inside Windows.

You need to be on a single-screen 
to obtain the VMWare Machine menu at the top by moving the mouse there.

0. Click Sharing.
0. Use the square + and - icons at the lower right.

PROTIP: Do not mirror a folder. It may take too much space.

### Shared Folder

This uses VMWare Tools installed from inside Windows.

0. Virtual Machine > Settings > Sharing

PROTIP: After unzip, delete the zip file to keep disk usage low.


### Defrag Windows

SSD drives should not be defragmented.

Only traditional spinning disks need to be defragmented,
to relocate where bits are stored so contiguously blocks
are available.

0. Before doing this, make a full backup to a USB external drive.
0. You'll need to use an Admin account.
0. Click the Start button.

## Microsoft Remote Desktop #

There are two programs that enable Mac users to access and <strong>take over</strong> 
Windows servers remotely,
using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol), also known as Terminal Services,
which uses port 3389:

A) <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=18140">
   Remote Desktop Client Connection for Macintosh</a>.

   RDC_2.1.1_ALL.dmg is 9.4 MB

B) <a target="_blank" href="http://cord.sourceforge.net/">CoRD on Sourceforge</a>,
   which is for Mac OS X 10.5â€”10.8 (obsolete when 10.12 Sierra is out?).

   CoRD_0.5.7.zip is 3.4 MB

   After running this, drag it into your Applications folder.

   To add a new server, click on the menu File.

C) <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id715768417?mt=12">
   Microsoft's Remote Desktop for Mac OSX from the Apple Store</a>.
  
   This is newer than the edition that comes with Microsoft Office for Mac 2011.

   This UI version is difficult because there are no favorites or sorting by last use,
   aliases, etc. (that I know of).  I now have to scroll down the list every time, 
   and remembering which of many cryptic names I want, which is difficult
   if you have a lot of servers on the list.

## Configuration

It's a good thing the classic Control Panel is still in Windows 10.
The Color Picker in the classic Control Panel is nested under "Appearance and Personalization", "Personalization", 
then "Color and Appearance."

The classic Control Panel enables you to create nearly any color you want for the accent color,
even though Windows 10 Personalization page of the Settings app
provides only a limited palette of 48 colors to choose from.


### Fink

   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.simplehelp.net/2007/05/09/how-to-install-linux-applications-in-os-x-a-complete-walkthrough/">
   Back in 2007</a>
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.finkproject.org/download/">
   Fink</a> was recommended. It is a package manager like Homebrew and MacPorts.
   Fink is Apt-based, so people will feel right at home coming from a <strong>Debian</strong> Linux environment.
   Its packages are binary,so no long compile times. But practically they are usually outdated and I had to compile stuff for my system anyway.
   It needs X11 installed.
