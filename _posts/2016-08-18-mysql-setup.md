This tutorial covers the basics for getting started with MySQL on Mac OSX,
PROTIPs and NOTEs are provided as instructions are presented in a hands-on way.

Content here was developed based on advice from <a href="#Resources">several websites</a>.

## From MySQL to MariaDB to Aurora #

MySQL was first proposed by Edgar Cord in 1970.
Its "open-source" free usage made it a natural choice for other open-source frameworks such as WordPress
and thus its rapid growth.

   NOTE: The "My" in MySQL is named after co-founder Michael's daughter, 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/my.widenius">My</a>,
   a character in a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Book_about_Moomin,_Mymble_and_Little_My">
   1952 children's book</a> from Finland, where her family originates.

After Oracle acquired Sun (MySQL's owner),
the freedom of open-source was realized when Maria-DB was forked 
to create a <strong>drop-in replacement for MySQL</strong>
by MySQL co-founder Michael ‚ÄúMonty‚Äù Widenius, 
who left Oracle to start a new company (Monty Program).

Many developers have migrated to MariaDB.
(MariaDB 5.1.53 is based on MySQL 5.1.53).
If you don't need to first uninstall MySQL,
<a href="#InstallMariaDB">click here for instructions on installing MariaDB, below</a>.

On August 2016, MariaDB's MaxScale database proxy software was put under the Business Software License, 
which means it's really not fully open source.


## MySQL Still Alive #

MySQL is thriving.

Uber in 
<a target="_blank" href="https://eng.uber.com/mysql-migration/">
2016 switched from Postgres to MySQL</a> under 
<a target="_blank" href="https://eng.uber.com/schemaless-part-one/">
Schemaless</a>. <a target="_blank" href="https://eng.uber.com/mysql-migration/">
More</a>. 

   * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNeZYVIfskc
   * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg76cNaeB4s
   <br /><br />

Uber's decision is based on similar success by
<a target="_blank" href="http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-aar-2014/slides/MartyWeiner_ScalingPinterest.pdf">
Pinterest</a> and
<a target="_blank" href="https://backchannel.org/blog/friendfeed-schemaless-mysql">
Friendfeed</a>, who said:

> "MySQL works. It doesn't corrupt data. Replication works. 
We understand its limitations already. 
We like MySQL for storage, just not RDBMS usage patterns.

Ironically, MySQL is a good choice for fast-growth companies because of its <strong>simplicity</strong>.

Uber uses MySQL to build a key-value store (hash map) 
which saves any JSON data without strict schema validation, 
in a schemaless fashion (hence the name \#schemaless).
It's much like <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/index">
Google Big Table</a>.

It has append-only sharded MySQL with buffered writes to support failing MySQL masters 
and a publish-subscribe feature for data change notification triggers. 
Lastly, Schemaless supports global indexes over the data.

The key difference is that the SQL schema is not used to designate domain information such as "inventory".



## Cloud instances #

There are several offerings that provide not only the database, but also
automation such as monitoring, 
scaling to provide capacity, 
backup/roll-back functionality,
auto-failover in several zones, 
auto-update of core software, etc.


### AWS Aurora #

<a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/">
https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora</a>
replaces MySQL in the AWS cloud, enabling scaling to 64 TB
and replicates across 3 zones.

Aurora is managed by the AWS RDS (Relational Data Service) (along with Postgres and DynamoDB).

   PROTIP: Many choose MySQL instead of DynamoDB for equivalent off-line capability
   since DynamoDB only works within the Amazon cloud.

It deals with:

   * instances
   * Security Groups
   * Parameter Groups
   * Snapshots
   <br /><br />
   
This means some limitations:

* Logs larger than 2% of storage allocated will get rotated every 24 hours.




### Google Cloud SQL #

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3107977/database/google-cloud-sql-provides-easier-mysql-for-all.html">
On August, 2016 Google announced</a>
Cloud SQL announced, a hosted version of MySQL 5.7 for the Google Cloud Platform.

## MySQL Docker

0. To start a mysql database in a docker container, run:

   <tt><strong>docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mysql.yml up -d
   </strong></tt>

0. To stop it and remove the container, run:

   <tt><strong>docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mysql.yml down
   </strong></tt>

0. To dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on,
   build a docker image of your app by running:

   <tt><strong>./mvnw package -Pprod docker:build
   </strong></tt>

0. Then run:

   <tt><strong>docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d
   </strong></tt>


<a name="InstallMySQL"></a>

## MySQL via Homebrew on Mac OSX #

### Install MySQL

PROTP: Use Homebrew instead of downloading from
   <a target="_blank" href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/">
   http://dev.mysql.com/downloads</a>, which gets you the latest version
   instead of one vetted.

0. Prepare the Homebrew environment (before any Homebrew install):

   <tt><strong>brew update
   </strong></tt>

   This can take several minutes.

   Resolve any issues reported.

   <tt><strong>brew doctor<br />
   brew upgrade
   </strong></tt>

   This can cause other packages to be downloaded, which can take several minutes.


0. Download and install the <strong>most recent</strong> version of the Homebrew installer:

   <tt><strong>brew install mysql
   </strong></tt>

   The response on July 4, 2017:

   <pre>

&nbsp;
To connect run:
    mysql -uroot
&nbsp;
To have launchd start mysql now and restart at login:
  brew services start mysql
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  mysql.server start
==> Summary

   </pre>

   PROTIP: Notice the installer is specific to the 
   version of Mac OSX (such as "Sierra" in this case).


   Alternately, to install a specific version, such as 5.6:

   <tt><strong>brew install mysql56
   </strong></tt>

0. After some time, to upgrade MySQL:

   <tt><strong>brew upgrade mysql
   </strong></tt>

   https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/osx-installation.html</a>

0. Verify install:

   <tt><strong>which mysql
   </strong></tt>

   The expected response:

   <pre>
   /usr/local/bin/mysql
   </pre>

   BLAH: But one cannot cd into that folder.


   ### Configure #

0. Set permissions for root access:

   <tt><strong>sudo chown -R mysql /usr/local/var/mysql/
   </strong></tt>

   Supply the password when prompted.

   No response is expected.

0. <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.joefallon.net/2013/10/install-mysql-on-mac-osx-using-homebrew/">

   ### Start daemon process #

0. Invoke mysql foreground daemon from the command line:

   <tt><strong>sudo mysql.server start
   </strong></tt>

   The response after supplying the password reflects the log file specific to your machine:

   <pre>
   Starting MySQL
   .Logging to '/usr/local/var/mysql/macs-MacBook-Pro-4.local.err'.
   . SUCCESS! 
   </pre>

   The prompt should now change to:

   <pre><strong>mysql >
   </strong></pre>

0. If you get this error message:

   <pre>
my_print_defaults: Can't read dir of '/usr/local/etc/my.cnf.d' (Errcode: 2 - No such file or directory)
my_print_defaults: [ERROR] Fatal error in defaults handling. Program aborted!
     </pre>

   <a target="_blank" href="http://codepodu.com/a-help-message-which-actually-is-helpful/">
   Fix the damage done by brew prune</a>:

   <tt><strong>mkdir /usr/local/etc/my.cnf.d
   </strong></tt>

   No response is expected. Try the command again.
   

   <a name="ListProcesses"></a>

0. List the daemons (processes) started by the command above,
   piped to filter the output:

   <tt><strong>ps -ax | grep mysql
   </strong></tt>

   A sample response (in addition to grep itself):

   <pre>
     PID TTY           TIME CMD
   21069 ttys002    0:00.02 /bin/sh /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.7.18_1/bin/mysqld_safe
         --datadir=/usr/local/var/mysql 
         --pid-file=/usr/local/var/mysql/macs-MacBook-Pro-4.local.pid
   21161 ttys002    0:00.33 /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.7.18_1/bin/mysqld

   </pre>

   If you want to use the database, proceed to <a href="#WorkSQL">Work with SQL</a> below.


   ### Invoke MySQL

0. Note one cannot just invoke mysql without specifying credentials, or this appears:

   <pre>ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'mac'@'localhost' (using password: NO)
   </pre>

0. The command in the <a href="#Caveats">Caveats</a> message state:

   <tt><strong>mysql -uroot
   </strong></tt>

   Alternately, to specify the password:

   <tt><strong>mysql -u root -p
   </strong></tt>

   <a href="#StartService">Start the MySQL service</a> if you see this:

   <pre>ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/tmp/mysql.sock' (2)</pre>

   BLAH: QUESTION: Fix this???

   <pre>mysql: Can't read dir of '/usr/local/etc/my.cnf.d' (Errcode: 2 - No such file or directory)
mysql: [ERROR] Fatal error in defaults handling. Program aborted!
   </pre>


   ### Stop server and process #

0. PROTIP: Stop the server before killing its process:

   <tt><strong>mysql.server stop
   </strong></tt>

0. To kill the processes:

   <tt><strong>sudo pkill mysql
   </strong></tt>

   No response is given unless you didn't use sudo:

   <pre>
   pkill: signalling pid 24162: Operation not permitted
   </pre>

   Alternately, specify by process ID (which is differs over time), for example:

   <tt><strong>kill -9 21069<br />
   kill -9 21161
   </strong></tt>


   <a name="UninstallMySQL"></a>

   ### Uninstall MySQL from Homebrew #

0. Remove MySQL:

   <tt><strong>brew remove mysql
   </strong></tt>

   Response:

   <pre>
   Uninstalling /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.7.13... (13,344 files, 445.0M)
   </pre>

0. Recover disk space from uninstalled items:

   <tt><strong>brew cleanup \-\-force
   </strong></tt>

   Response:

   <pre>
   ==> This operation has freed approximately 318.2MB of disk space.
   </pre>

0. Remove services MacOS invokes when a user logs in:

   <tt><strong>sudo ls ~/Library/LaunchAgents
   </strong></tt>

   If file "homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist" exists, remove it:

   <tt><strong>sudo rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist
   </strong></tt>

   NOTE: In previous versions, the file was "com.mysql.mysqld.plist".

0. Remove lefover database files:

   <tt><strong>ls /usr/local/var/mysql
   </strong></tt>

   If files exist there, remove them all:

   <tt><strong>sudo rm -rf /usr/local/var/mysql
   </strong></tt>

   Skipping the above step means you will not be able to log in as root initially to set the password.



<a name="InstallMariaDB"></a>

## MariaDB via Homebrew #

MariaDB ships with additional storage engines installed 
(with no additional compilation as with MySQL):
Aria, XtraDB (an enhanced and extended version of the InnoDB storage engine), PBXT, FederatedX (a drop-in replacement for Federated), OQGraph, and SphinxSE 
in addition to standard MyISAM, blackhole, CSV, Memory, etc.

   <pre><strong>show storage engines;
   </strong></pre>

<a target="_blank" href="http://kb.askmonty.org/v/mariadb">
http://kb.askmonty.org/v/mariadb</a> is the MariaDB Knowledgebase. 

0. Take a full backup before doing this.
0. If you have MySQL installed, <a href="#UninstallMySQL">uninstall MySQL</a>.
0. If you have MariaDB installed:

   <tt><strong>brew uninstall mariadb \-\-force -s
   </strong></tt>

   `-s` clears the brew cache.

   `--force` is needed in the command to avoid this:

   <pre>Error: No such keg: /usr/local/Cellar/mariadb
   </pre>

   No response is returned if it worked.

0. Remove dead symlinks:

   <tt><strong>brew prune
   </strong></tt>

   The response, for example:

   <pre>Pruned 0 symbolic links and 17 directories from /usr/local
   </pre>

0. Install MariaDB:

   <tt><strong>brew install mariadb
   </strong></tt>

   If MySQL is already installed, the response is:

   <pre>
   Error: Cannot install mariadb because conflicting formulae are installed.
   mysql: because mariadb, mysql, and percona install the same binaries.
   </pre>

   If you get the above, uninstall mysql, kill the processes running, and try again.

   The response:

   <pre>
==> Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/mariadb-10.1.14.el_capitan.
######################################################################## 100.0%
==> Pouring mariadb-10.1.14.el_capitan.bottle.tar.gz
==> Caveats
A "/etc/my.cnf" from another install may interfere with a Homebrew-built
server starting up correctly.
&nbsp;
To connect:
    mysql -uroot
&nbsp;
To have launchd start mariadb now and restart at login:
  brew services start mariadb
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  mysql.server start
==> Summary
üç∫  /usr/local/Cellar/mariadb/10.1.14: 573 files, 131.1M
   </pre>

   Before you boldly start:

0. Verify

   <tt><strong>which mysql
   </strong></tt>

   The response:

   <pre>/usr/local/bin/mysql
   </pre>

0. Invoke interactively from the command line:

   <tt><strong>echo $TMPDIR
   </strong></tt>

   Sample response:

   <pre>
   /var/folders/j_/gh27gpxj1t58hyryfg9drvdc0001gn/T/
   </pre>

0. Now clear it:

   <tt><strong>unset TMPDIR
   </strong></tt>

   Do another echo to get a blank response.

0. Invoke interactively from the command line (all in one line):

   <tt><strong>mysql_install_db \-\-verbose \-\-user=`whoami` \-\-basedir="$(brew \-\-prefix mariadb)" \-\-datadir=/usr/local/var/mysql 
   </strong></tt>

   NOTE: The `whoami` returns the output from running the whoami command.

   In previous examples, "--tmpdir=/tmp" is not recognized.


<a name="WorkSQL"></a>

## Work with SQL #

0. Define a root password to secure your installation using the provided script:

   <tt><strong>mysql_secure_installation
   </strong></tt>

   This invokes the script in a folder such as:<br />
   /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.5.10/bin/<br />
   (depending on the version installed).

   The response:

   <pre>
   Securing the MySQL server deployment.
   &nbsp;
   Connecting to MySQL using a blank password.
   Segmentation fault: 11
   </pre>

   CAUTION: This is where I'm stuck now.

   with one you create)

   <pre><strong>mysqladmin -u root password <em>[newpassword]</em>
   </strong></pre>

   PROTIP: Write the password in a secure document and paste it in the command
   to be sure you have it correct in the future.

   ### SequelPro

   PROTIP: Use Sequel Pro's Export and Import features (use a MySQL dump) to move databases.

   NOTE: There is no brew install sequelpro.

0. Download SequelPro SQL client from

   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sequelpro.com/">http://www.sequelpro.com</a>

0. In the Downloads folder click the file downloaded
   (sequel-pro-1.1.2.dmg as of June 2016).
0. In the window that pops up, click "Sequel Pro".
0. Click "Open" in the "downloaded from the internet" dialog.
0. Click X to dismiss the "Sequel Pro" window.
0. Press command+tab to select Sequel Pro's "pancake" icon.

   QUESTION: Where is this installed?

0. Pinch with three fingers for the Mac's Launch window.

0. Use <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sequelpro.com/docs/Keyboard_Shortcuts">
   SequelPro's keyboard shortcuts</a>.

   <a name="Sockets"></a>

   ### Sockets #

0. Since OS X expects the MySQL socket <strong>mysql.sock</strong> 
   to be in folder <strong>/var/mysql</strong>, 
   create it and add a symbolic link to where the socket actually lives:

   <pre><strong>cd \
   sudo mkdir /var/mysql
   sudo chmod 755 /var/mysql
   sudo ln -s /tmp/mysql.sock /var/mysql/mysql.sock
   </strong></pre>

   Alternately, installation of MySQL 5 by MacPorts places the Socket File in folder:

   <pre>
   /opt/local/var/run/mysql5/mysqld.sock
   </pre>

   and data files in

   <pre>
   /opt/local/var/db/mysql5/
   </pre>

   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sequelpro.com/docs/Where_are_MySQLs_Files">
   http://www.sequelpro.com/docs/Where_are_MySQLs_Files</a>

0. Create a new connection via the Socket option without changing any settings.

   Both MySQL and MariaDB use main configuration file <strong>my.cnf</strong>. 



## Interactive mode #

http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/
MySQL Workbench install on mac

The command-line client is mysql.


0. Start the mysqld server so anyone can log in with full permissions:

   <tt><strong>mysqld_safe \-\-skip-grant-tables
   </strong></tt>

   Open another Terminal shell window on any folder.

0. Log in without a password:

   <tt><strong>mysql -u root
   </strong></tt>

   The response:

   <pre>
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 2

   See <a target="_blank" href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/connecting-disconnecting.html">
   docs on Connecting to and Disconnecting from the Server</a>

0. To exit, type in quit and press Enter:

   <tt><strong>quit
   </strong></tt>

   Then bring up mysql again.

0. To start automatically upon server start:

   <pre>#start
   launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist
&nbsp;
   #stop
   launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist
   </pre>




<a name="VerifyDB"></a>

## List databases #

There are two ways to get a list of databases:

0. From the command line:

   <tt><strong>mysqlshow
   </strong></tt>

   From within MySQL:

   <tt><strong>show databases;
   </strong></tt>

   The expected response on a newly created instance:

   <pre>
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
+--------------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
   </pre>



<a name="MySQLAdmin"></a>

## MySQLAdmin #

mysqladmin is a command-line interface for administrators to perform server administration tasks.

0. On a Terminal command line:

   <tt><strong>mysqladmin
   </strong></tt>

   The response is long, starting with...

   <pre>
mysqladmin  Ver 8.42 Distrib 5.7.13, for osx10.11 on x86_64
Copyright (c) 2000, 2016, Oracle and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.

&nbsp;
Administration program for the mysqld daemon.
Usage: mysqladmin [OPTIONS] command command....
   </pre>

<a name="ManageUsers"></a>

## Manage Users #

0. List users in the mysql system database by specifying a single line:

   <tt><strong>use mysql; select * from user;
   </strong></tt>

0. List users by entering SQL commands in several lines: 

   <tt><strong>SELECT * FROM information_schema.TABLES
   </strong></tt>

   The response is an arrow:

   <pre>
   ->
   </pre>

   To exit, press control+C then Enter.

   Enter more lines:

   <tt><strong>WHERE TABLE_NAME LIKE '%user%'
   </strong></tt>

   To have mysql process the statement lines, type a semicolon and press Enter:

   <tt><strong>
   ;
   </strong></tt>


   The response should be a row containing:

   <pre>
   mysql   user    BASE TABLE  MyISAM
   </pre>


0. Reset all the root passwords (the password being "password"):

   <tt><strong>UPDATE mysql.user SET Password=PASSWORD('NewPassword') WHERE User='root';<br />
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   </strong></tt>

   If you kill the running copy of mysqld_safe and 
   start mysql again without the skip-grant-tables option, 
   you should be able to log in with mysql -u root -p and the new password you just set.




<a name="CreateDB"></a>

## Create a database #

These commands are entered `mysql>`.

0. Create: 

   <tt><strong>create database sampledb;
   </strong></tt>

   The response:

   <pre>
   Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
   </pre>


0. Switch

   <tt><strong>use sampledb;
   </strong></tt>


<a name="CommandFiles"></a>

## Command Files #

PROTIP: Interact with the databae via batch-submitted files for repeatability.

0. Copy a file SQL code from GitHub.

   TBD

PROTIP: Interact with the databae via batch-submitted files for repeatability.

0. Save the SQL script to a folder such as ~/sql.

0. Invoke a SQL script using the Linux source command:

   <tt><strong>mysql < ~/sql/sqlfile1
   </strong></tt>

0. Invoke a SQL script using the Linux source command:

   <tt><strong>source file_name<br />
   \. file_name
   </strong></tt>

   About the sample database creation

0. Since the script creates the database, 
   the repeatable script needs to begin by deleting it:

   <pre>
   DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS sampledb;
   </pre>

0. PROTIP: If a SQL script needs to create several databases,
   group the various actions for a particular database together rather than
   doing each step for each database.

   <pre>
   DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS sampledb;
   create database sampledb;
   use sampledb;
   </pre>


   To create a database based on

## InnoDB Engine #

InnoDB is newer, faster, and scales better than the MyISAM database engine.

Allocate a maximum amount of RAM to your MySQL instance with the 
<strong>innodb_buffer_pool_size</strong> parameter and give at least 15Mb to the 
<strong>query_cache_size</strong> parameter.
