This is a tutorial on the different ways to "remote into" a Windows instance from a MacOS or Linux machine.

<a name="RDC"></a>

## Windows machine to Windows machine

Every Microsoft Windows operating system instance can reach another Windows machine because all Windows operating systems come, within Start Programs > Accessories, a RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) client program that can be used without being an Administrator. It uses uses <strong>port 3389</strong>. The RDP is also known as "Terminal Services".

### Remote Desktop Connection 

If you are running a Windows virtual instance (under VMWare Fusion), etc., this is available by default on all Windows machines.

So you can click a file that opens the program.
If you have a rdp file, click on it:<br />
   `ec2-54-219-170-140.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com.rdp`

   This way you see the dialog filled in.

Alternately, open the program manually:

1. Click the "Start" Windows start button.
2. Click the "Remote Desktop" icon on the Windows 10/2016 Desktop:

   Alternately, type enough of <strong>Remote</strong> to see "Remote Desktop Connection" appear for you to click.

   Alternately, type <strong>mstsc</strong> to see "Remote Desktop Connection" appear for you to click.

   Either way:

0. In the "Remote Desktop Connection" dialog, paste into the Computer Name: field the DNS name such as<br />
   `ec2-54-219-170-140.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com`

   Back to the dialog:

0. Click "Get Password".

## Other operating systems

On other operating systems (such as MacOS or Linux), if you have no administrative rights on your corporate Windows laptop, spin up cloud instances in the cloud and access them via a client that uses RDP.

### RDP clients on Linux

On Linux machines, there is RDesktop at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rdesktop.org/.">http://www.rdesktop.org</a>

### RDP clients on MacOS

<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-mac">Microsoft's DOC</a>

On the Mac, these RDP clients can reach into instances of Amazon EC2 or other cloud that house Windows servers.

### Microsoft Remote Desktop Client gone #

Microsoft's Remote Desktop Client Connection 2.1.1 for Macintosh (installer RDC_2.1.1_ALL.dmg at 9.4 MB) is no longer available for download from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=18140">here</a> http://www.microsoft.com/mac/downloads.

### Microsoft's Remote Desktop for Mac OSX from Apple

1. Click <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id715768417?mt=12">
   this link at the Apple Store</a>.

   ![rd-mac-650x319-67997](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/30454978-75873748-995b-11e7-94b0-2947c3271794.jpg)

   NOTE: This is newer than the edition that comes with Microsoft Office for Mac 2011.

0. Click the blue "View in Mac App Store".
0. Within the Mac AppStore app, click Get.

 0. Click + New

   BLAH: This UI version is difficult because there are no favorites or sorting by last use,
   aliases, etc. (that I know of).  I now have to scroll down the list every time, 
   and remembering which of many cryptic names I want, which is difficult
   if you have a lot of servers on the list.
