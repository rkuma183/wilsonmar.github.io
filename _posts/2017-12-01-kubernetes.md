<hr />

{% include _toc.html %}

This page is being actively worked on, so please pardon the "dust".

This is a hands-on tutorial with commentary along the way.

## Terminology background

Kubernetes is often abbreviated as "k8s", with 8 replacing the number of characters between k and s.

Kubernetes is the ancient Greek word for "helmsman" (people who pilot cargo ships). 
Thus the nautical references and why k8s experts are called "captain" and why associated products have nautical themes,
such as "Helm".

## Why Kubernetes?

K8s automates the deployment (creation) of Dockerized apps running as <strong>containers</strong> within 
<strong>pods</strong> arranged in <strong>clusters</strong> of <strong>nodes</strong>
(previously called minions).

![k8s-container-sets-479x364](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/33526550-6c98a980-d800-11e7-9862-ff202492e08b.jpg)
<!-- From https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/getting-started-kubernetes/exercise-files -->

BTW, instead of Docker, Kubernetes also works with <strong>rkt</strong> (pronounced "rocket").
But this tutorial focuses on Docker.

that the Kubernetes logo has 7 sides because its initial developers were Star Trek fans:
The predecessor to Kubernetes was called Borg.
A key Borg character is called "7 of 9".

Anyway, its Google heritage means Kubernetes is about scaling for a lot of traffic
with redundancies to achieve high availability (HA).

Kubernetes was created inside Google (using the [Golang](/Golang/) programming language)
and used for over a decade before being open-sourced in 2014 to the

EKS runs three Kubernetes masters across three Availability Zones in order to ensure high availability. 
EKS automatically provides a "highly available and scalable Kubernetes service"
EKS automatically detects and replaces unhealthy masters, and provides automated version upgrades and patching for the masters. 
so you don't have to choose appropriate instance types.

## What is Kub?

Kubernetes is called an "orchestrator" of various <a href="#micro-services">micro-service apps</a>
built from Docker <strong>images</strong> in a <strong>binary repository</strong> (such as Nexus or Artifactory).
The images are built by Docker reading <strong>Dockerfiles</strong> in a configuration source repository such as GitHub.

<a target="_blank" title="from Yongbok Kim (who writes in Korean)" href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ko&tl=en&u=http://www.yongbok.net/blog/google-kubernetes-container-cluster-manager/">

Deployments manage Pods. 

Every Pod has a unique IP. There is one IP Address per Pod.
In other words, containers within a Pod share a network namespace. 

Every container has its own unique <strong>port number</strong> within its pod's IP.

Containers also share attached data <strong>volumes</strong> available within each Pod.

<a href="#kubelet">Kubelet agents</a>

System administrators control the <strong>Master node</strong>
UI in the cloud or write scripts that invoke 
<a href="#kubectl">kubectl command-line client program</a>
that controls the <strong>Kubernetes Master</strong> node.

The program talks to the <strong>Kubernetes API Server</strong>.

The Server gets Scheduler ???

The Server obtains from Controller Manager ???

The API Server and Scheduler stores data in an <a href="#ETCD">ETCD Cluster</a>.

Kubernetes instantiates and then manages the state of containers.

The Kube Proxy communicates only with Pod admin. whereas
Kubelets communicate with individual pods as well.

## cAdvisor

cAdvisor https://github.com/google/cadvisor
(Container Advisor) collects, aggregates, processes, and exports information about running containers in order to
provide container admins an understanding of the resource usage and performance characteristics of their running containers.

## Options for deployment

There are several ways to obtain a running instance of Kubernetes,
listed from easiest to most difficult:

A) "Kubernetes Engine" is a container management SaaS product running within the Google Compute Platform (GCP) on top of Google Compute Engine providing machines. It was previously called Google Container Engine (GKE). 

   But one can run k8s containers in other clouds or within private data centers.

A) <a href="#Minikube">Minikube spins up a local environment on your laptop</a>.

B) <a href="#DockerHub">Pull an image from Docker Hub</a> 
   within a Google Compute or AWS cloud instance.

C) <a href="#Dockerfile">Use a Dockerfile to build your own Docker image containing Kubernetes</a>.

D) <a href="Homebrew">Use Homebrew to install Kubernetes natively on you Mac</a>.

E) <a href="#BinaryInstall">Download installer to install locally</a>.

CAUTION: If you are in a large enterprise, confer with your security team before 
installing. They often have a repository such as Artifactory or Nexus where
installers are available after being vetted and perhaps patched
for security vulnerabilities.


<a name="Minikube"></a>

### Minikube

Minikube goes beyond Docker For Mac (DFM) and Docker for Windows (DFW)
and includes a node and a Master when it spins up in a local environment (such as your laptop).

CAUTION: At time of writing, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube">https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube</a>
has 257 issues and 20 pending Pull Requests.

1. Install on a Mac:
 
   <pre><strong>
   brew install docker-machine-driver-xhyve
   </strong></pre>

   Also:

   <pre><strong>
   brew install minikube -y
   </strong></pre>

   BLAH: On Nov 9, 2017 I got an error message doing the above.

2. Verify if it can be invoked:

   <pre>minikube version</pre>

3. Start the service:

   On Mac:

   <pre>
   minikube start --vm-driver=xhyve
   </pre>

   On Windows:

   <pre>
   minikube start --vm-driver=hyperv
   </pre>

3. Dashboard

   <pre>minikube dashboard</pre>

4. Stop the service:

   <pre>minikube stop</pre>

5. Recover space:

   <pre>minikube delete</pre>

Kubectl 1.8 scale is now the preferred way to control graceful delete.

Kubectl 1.8 rollout and rollback now support stateful sets ???


<a name="kubectl"></a>

## kubectl CLI client install

Running outside Kubernetes servers is <strong>`kubectl`</strong> (kube + ctl), 
the CLI tool for k8s. It's automatically installed within Google cloud instances.

1. Install on a Mac:
 
   <pre><strong>
   brew install kubectl -y
   </strong></pre>

   <pre>
ðº  /usr/local/Cellar/kubernetes-cli/1.8.3: 108 files, 50.5MB
   </pre>

0. Verify
 
   <pre><strong>
   kubectl version --client
   </strong></pre>

## Sample micro-service apps

I have built a GitHub repository containing example apps and utilities that process them at:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wilsonmar/DevSecOps/Kubernetes">
   https://github.com/wilsonmar/DevSecOps/Kubernetes</a>

The remainder of this tutorial refers to files in this repository.

The repo is based on work from others, 
especially Kelsy Hightower, the Google Developer Advocate.

   * https://github.com/kelseyhightower/app - an example 12-Factor application. 
   * https://hub.docker.com/r/kelseyhightower/monolith - Monolith includes auth and hello services.

## Infrastructure as code

1. Use an internet browser to view 

   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wilsonmar/DevSecOps/blob/master/Kubernetes/k8s-gcp-hello.sh">
   https://github.com/wilsonmar/DevSecOps/blob/master/Kubernetes/k8s-gcp-hello.sh</a>

   The script downloads a repository forked from googlecodelabs:
   https://github.com/wilsonmar/orchestrate-with-kubernetes/tree/master/kubernetes

   ### Declarative
   
   This repository contains several kinds of .yaml files, which can also have the extension .yml.
   Kubernetes also recognizes .json files, but YAML files are easier to work with.

   The files are call "Manifests" because they declare the desired state.


2. Open an internet browser tab to view it.

   ### reverse proxy to front-end

   The web service consists of a front-end and a proxy served by the NGINX web server configured using two files in the `nginx` folder:

   * frontend.conf
   * proxy.conf

   These are explained in detail at https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-nginx-as-a-web-server-and-reverse-proxy-for-apache-on-one-ubuntu-14-04-droplet

   ### SSL keys

   SSL keys referenced are installed from the `tls` folder:

   * ca-key.pem - Certificate Authority's private key
   * ca.pem - Certificate Authority's public key
   * cert.pem - public key
   * key.pem - private key

   ### Deployments

   * auth.yaml
   * frontend.yaml
   * hello-green.yaml

### How Kubernetes Engine works

![kubernetes-pods-599x298-35069](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/31013696-81d30fc0-a4d4-11e7-9852-36be55b74499.jpg)

Pods are defined by a <a href="#Manifest">manifest file</a> 
read by the <strong>apiserver</strong> which deploys nodes.

Nodes were previously called "minions" who do work.
Apparently Google namers forgot about the existance of NodeJS.

Pods abstact the network and storage of containers. 
So each <strong>pod</strong> can hold one or more containers, all of which <strong>share the same IP address</strong>, hostname, namespaces, and other resources. 

Pods go into "succeeded" state after being run because
pods have short lifespans -- deleted and recreated as necessary.

Each container has a different port.
Containers within the same pod are on the same localhost.

Pods are replicated across several Compute Engine nodes.

The <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com./container-engine/docs/replicationcontrollers/">
replication controller</a> automatically adds or removes pods to comply with the specified number of pod replicas declared are running across nodes.
This makes GKE "self healing" to provide high availability and reliability with
"autoscaling" up and down based on demand.

In <a target="_blank" href="https://x-team.com/blog/introduction-kubernetes-architecture/">this diagram</a>:


From the https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl-cheatsheet/

0. List all pods, including in the system namespace:

   <pre><strong>
   kubectl get nodes --all-namespaces
   </strong></pre>

   Included are pods named:
   * api server (aka "master") accepts kubectl commands
   * <a href="#etcd">etcd</a> (cluster store) for HA (High Availability) in control pane
   * controller to watch for changes and maintain desired state
   * dns (domain name server)
   * proxy load balances across all pods in a service
   * scheduler watches api server for new pods to assign work to new pods
   <br /><br />

0. List app pods in the default namespace:

   <pre><strong>
   kubectl get nodes
   </strong></pre>

0. For more details:

   <pre><strong>
   kubectl describe pods
   </strong></pre>

### Replication rc.yml

The `rc.yml` (Replication Controller) defines the number of replicas and 

   <pre>
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name:   cadvisor
spec:
  replicas: 5
  selector:
     app hello
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello-world
  spec:
    containers:
    - name: hello
      image: account/image:latest
      ports:
        containerPort: 8080
   </pre>


0. Apply replication:

   <pre><strong>
   kubectl apply -f rc.yml
   </strong></pre>

   The response expected:

   <pre>
   replicationcontroller "hello" configured
   </pre>

0. List, in wide format, the number of replicated nodes:

   <pre><strong>
   kubectl get rc -o wide
   </strong></pre>

   <pre>
   DESIRED, CURRENT, READY
   </pre>

0. Get more detail:

   <pre><strong>
   kubectl describe rc
   </strong></pre>


<a name="ServiceYml"></a>

### Service rc.yml

The `svc.yml` defines the services:

   <pre>
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello-svc
    labels:
      app: hello-world
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - port: 8080
    protocol: TCP
  selector:
    app: hello-world
   </pre>

   PROTIP: The selector should match the pods.xml.

0. Create services:

   <pre><strong>
   kubectl create -f svc.yml
   </strong></pre>

   The response expected:

   <pre>
   service "hello-svc" created
   </pre>

0. List:

   <pre><strong>
   kubectl get svc
   </strong></pre>

0. List details:

   <pre><strong>
   kubectl describe svc hello-svc
   </strong></pre>

0. List end points addresses:

   <pre><strong>
   kubectl describe ep hello-svc
   </strong></pre>


<a name="DeploymentYml"></a>

### Deploy yml

The `deploy.yml` defines the deploy:

   <pre>
apiVersion: v1beta
kind: Deployment
   </pre>

Deployment wraps around <strong>replica sets</strong>, a newer version of doing rolling-update on Replication Controller. Old replica sets can revert roll-back by just changing the deploy.yml file.


<a name="Kubelet"></a>

## Kubelet Daemonset.yaml

Kubelets instantiate pods -- each a set of containers running under a single IP address,
the fundamental units nodes.

A Kubelet <strong>agent program</strong> is installed on each server
to watch the apiserver and register each node with the cluster.

PROTIP: Use a DaemonSet when running clustered Kubernetes with static pods to run a pod on every node. Static pods are managed directly by the kubelet daemon on a specific node, without the API server observing it. 

   * https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/

A DaemonSet ensures that all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a Pod. 
As nodes are added to the cluster, Pods are added to them. 
As nodes are removed from the cluster, those Pods are garbage collected. 

Deleting a DaemonSet will clean up the Pods it created.
Some typical uses of a DaemonSet are:

   * running a cluster storage daemon, such as glusterd, ceph, on each node.
   * running a logs collection daemon on every node, such as fluentd or logstash.
   * running a node monitoring daemon on every node, such as Prometheus Node Exporter, collectd, Datadog agent, New Relic agent, or Ganglia gmond.

1. Start kubelet daemon:

   <pre><strong>
   kubelet --pod-manifest-path=<em>the directory</em> 
   </strong></pre>

   This periodically scans the directory and creates/deletes static pods as yaml/json files appear/disappear there. 

   Note: Kubelet ignores files starting with a dot when scanning the specified directory.

   PROTIP: By default, Kubelets exposes endpoints on port <strong>10255</strong>.

   Containers can be Docker or rkt (pluggable)

   /spec, /healthz reports status.

The container engine pulls images and stopping/starting containers.

etcd provides a reliable way to notify the rest of the cluster about configuration changes for
shared configuration and service discovery.

Data stored by Kubernetes in etcd includes jobs being scheduled, created and deployed, pod/service details and state, namespaces and replication information, etc.

etcd provides a REST API for CRUD operations as well as an interface to register watchers on specific nodes.

etcd is a simple, distributed, consistent key-value store.


### CNI

The Controller Network Interface is installed using 
basic cbr0 using the bridge and host-local CNI plugins.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/network-plugins/

The CNI plugin is selected by passing Kubelet the command-line option:

   <pre>
   --network-plugin=cni 
   </pre>
