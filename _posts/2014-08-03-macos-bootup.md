## Boot-up

During boot-up (Apple logo):

<ul>
<li> Hold down the start button for a hard reset.</li>
<li> Hold down &#8984; + R gets you the Recovery menu. </li>
<li> Hold down &#8984; + option + P + R to reset Parameter RAM.</li>

<li> Hold down C to boot from CD.</li>
<li> Hold down option key to select startup disk.</li>
<li> Hold down shift key to boot in Safe Mode.</li>
</ul>

If pressing the start button does not work:

<ol type="1">
<li> Unplug the magsafe power cable.</li>
<li> Hold down the power button for about 10 seconds and keeping pressing.</li>
<li> While still holding the power button down, insert the magsafe power cable 
and hold it for another 10 sec.</li>
<li> Release the power button and 
make a "normal" press as if you would normally turn on your computer.</li>
</ol>

If that doesn't work then try to remove one RAM memory and 
switch places before repeating the above.

During login:

<ul>
<li> Hold down shift key to prevent startup items from 
loading.</li>
</ul>
