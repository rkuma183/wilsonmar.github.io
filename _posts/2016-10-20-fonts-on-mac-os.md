I had to install several fonts and throught you'd want to benefit from my experience.

<a name="Brew"></a>

## Easy install via Homebrew Fonts

The easiest way to install free fonts is to use <a target="_blank" href="https://caskroom.github.io">Homebrew Caskroom</a>.

1. First, do this command one time to configure:

   <tt><strong>
   brew tap caskroom/fonts
   </strong></tt>

   The response at time of writing:

   <pre>
==> Tapping caskroom/fonts
Cloning into '/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/caskroom/homebrew-fonts'...
remote: Counting objects: 1140, done.

remote: Total 1140 (delta 769), reused 527 (delta 459), pack-reused 0

Resolving deltas: 100% (769/769), done.
Tapped 0 formulae (1,156 files, 945.1KB)
   </pre>

2. See the list of fonts at:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-fonts/tree/master/Casks">
   https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-fonts/tree/master/Casks</a>

3. For each font you want installed. The most popular are:

   <tt><strong>
   brew cask install font-open-sans
   </strong></tt>

   PROTIP: This draws from font-open-sans.rb at
   https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-fonts/blob/master/Casks/font-open-sans.rb

   Note in the response that all the variants are installed:

   <pre>

## Bitmap vs vector

There are two ways fonts are drawn - as bitmaps dots or as vectors by a program. 

Vector fonts are better on my Apple monitors with 1080p HD and above
because they allow more efficient scaling.

When using old monitors with lower resolution below 720p,
bitmap fonts are better because they are generally more legible at smaller sizes on low-resolution screens.


## Mono-spaced Programming Fonts

I am not satisfied with standard fonts to display programming code. 

Characters should be clear, easy to read, in cases of clashing ones such as 1, l, i or O, o, 0 easily distinguishable, differences between different kinds of brackets, quotes and parentheses should be clear, punctuation should be emphasized and they shouldn't break up words or sentences due to uneven character widths.

My main criteria is a <strong>narrow</strong> font so more characters fit on a line.

* https://www.slant.co/topics/67/viewpoints/7/~programming-fonts~ubuntu-mono
   It has a weird "m".

* https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro
  described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Code_Pro 

* Consolas is not proportional, so columns line up.

### Meslo LG Multi-Platform

Now one would think that Apple engineers are rather particular about fonts.

Since Snow Leopard, Menlo-Regular is the default font for Apple‚Äôs
developer tools and the Terminal.
(which is a customized Bitstream Vera Sans Mono).

But no.

One guy has nitpicky gripes with it:

   * The default vertical (line) spacing is just way too cramped 

   * The horizontal baseline alignment of the asterisk is off

So he created a customized version of Apple‚Äôs font.

   https://github.com/andreberg/Meslo-Font

His website has a "DZ" edition with dots inside zeros so no one can confuse them for upper case letter O.

   https://github.com/andreberg/Meslo-Font/blob/master/dist/v1.2.1/Meslo%20LG%20v1.2.1.zip

Thanks to his work, we now have a good fixed-sized font that works across Mac and Windows.

### GoLang fonts

The font family, called Go, includes proportional- and fixed-width faces in normal, bold, and italic renderings.
