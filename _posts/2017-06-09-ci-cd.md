Here is my explanation of the different
levels of CI/CD "maturity", 
thus providing a road-map for adoption of "DevOps" automation.

<hr />

## 1. Deploy script

   When an individual developer works alone, 
   a script written for Make of Ant programs to perform builds
   saves a few seconds versus typing commands.

   Such scripts are usually stored along with code in a Git repository.

## 2. Nightly builds on deploy server

   When developers work together, a separate server running build
   scripts avoids disturbing individual workers.

   Running build scripts nightly ensures that not much time goes by
   before catching <strong>integration issues</strong> between
   components. 

   The simplest integration issue is whether Java or C# code can
   all compile and be assembled into a final executable.

   Such runs can be initiated on a nightly schedule
   by a <strong>cron</strong> utility program that comes with
   Linux operating systems.

   At this point, the team may feel little obligation to fix broken builds immediately, and builds may stay broken on the build server. 

## 3. Local unit tests

   Developers who favor the "TDD" (Test Driven Development) approach
   begin by writing tests to check whether code returns output expected.
   Initially, the test would fail. 
   The first lines within a module may be error checking code that
   returns negative responses.

   But when working code is added that return positive results,
   that code is counted as "done".

   This approach enables a tenant of an Agile programming principle
   of measuring completion by working software rather than 
   just the number of lines of code written.

   In the Java world, JUnit is the de facto standard, although TestNG is also popular.
   For C# applications, the NUnit testing framework proposes similar functionalities to those provided by JUnit, as does Test::Unit for Ruby. 
   For C/C+ +, there is CppUnit.
   PHP developers can use PHPUnit.

   Becuase "xUnit" tools all create result reports in XML format,
   they can be displayed using the same "xUnit Plugin" for Jenkins.

   Jenkins makes the distinction between failed builds and unstable builds. Failed builds are indicated by a red ball. Unstable builds not considered of sufficient quality are inicated by a yellow ball.

## 4. Team-level repository

   When developers commit their work to a team repository
   in small increments of working code, the team's actual progress can be measured in those increments. This may save time reporting
   progress. Those who want to know can simply view a 
   <a href="#Dashboard">dashboard</a>.

   Use of a versioned repositories enable the team to back out a release and roll back to a previous release if something goes horribly wrong.

   Also, when a developer retrieves team-level code from the team repository (using a Git fetch or pull command), Git automatically
   identifies whether several people have worked on the same lines in the same file.

## 5. Team-level unit tests

   Even when code does not directly conflict with another developerâ€™s work, running programs may conflict with others who share memory
   or other resources.

   Running individual unit tests along with other unit tests may
   reveal conflicts.

## 6. Code quality checks

   Developers are increasingly adding use of code scanners
   such as SonarQube to automatically ensure that all code complies
   with rules.

   There is still value in a team talking about each other's work.

   However, automation enables the team to focus on substantive topics
   while leaving each individual to deal with repetitive issues 
   that can be identified automatically.

## 7. Automated unit tests

   The introduction of a continuous integration server 
   such as Jenkins enable event rather than calendar driven 
   kick off of build automation.

   Such an event is typically when new code is committed to the version control system. The mechanism is called a "web hook" in GitHub/GitLab.

   In addition to doing builds, Jenkins can kick off test automation
   if a build is successful. Such a mechanism is called
   "post-build actions". 

## 8. Code Coverage

   There are programs which identify whether test code covers
   (cause to execute) specific lines of code.


   <a name="Alerts"></a>

## 9. Alerts 

   To notify people when builds fail, Jenkins can 
   can be configured to send out emails which may 
   contain logs and reports from builds and test jobs.

   Jenkins has a wide range of ready-built APIs to call which use more proactive channels such as <strong>Instant Messaging</strong>.

   Such mechanisms are often used to run "smoke" tests to detect
   whether a system is still working so that people can be alerted
   to troubleshoot before too much time goes by.

   <a name="OverTime"></a>

## 10. Alerts based on previous metric values

   Performance or "speed" tests are often included to measure the
   response time for a single simulated user.
   Such metrics for various transactions in the program
   are maintained over time so that developers are alerted if
   response times suddenly slower than historical averages.

   This provides an early warning system for possible issues
   before additional labor is spent on an architecture that 
   needs re-design.


   <a name="Dashboard"></a>

## 11. Metrics dashboard and retention

   By default, Jenkins maintains a history of builds.

   Annotations, such as the origin of test failures 
   and how to fix them, can be added to a job
   using the Edit Description link in the top right-hand corner of the Jenkins screen.

   However, Jenkins does not aggregate a group of jobs for
   display in a single dashboard.

   A dedicated computer monitor dedicated to such constant display
   (like at an airport) is often called a "build radiator".

   Some dashboards consolidate measures of efficiency and effectiveness
   into a single metric.

## 12. System-level integration tests

   While individual unit tests typically use static (unchanging) data,
   tests of whether individual components "integrate" with each other
   tend to use more <strong>dynamic data</strong> which change
   during a test run.

   Tests of API (Application Programming Interfaces) using
   "microservices" are conducted at this level.

   This step requires the team to identify 

## 13. User-level acceptance tests

   Automation of tests that focus on what end-users do are called Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and Acceptance-Test Driven Development (ATDD). Examples of tools for this are
   Cucumber, fitnesse, jbehave, rspec, easyb, etc. 

   The end-user focus also enable the automation that proves what user features have been implemented, and which remain to be done. 

   Stress and load testing are done at this level.

## 14. Regression testing

   Regression testing ensure that everything still works after
   changes are made.

   Investments in automation are returned in savings from wasted labor
   repeating tests during each cycle of change.

   Individual xUnit tests can be temporarily deactivated using the
   `@Test(enabled=false)` annotation.

## 15. Continuous Deployment

   The use of build and test automation enables a team to have confidence that potential defects can be caught before appearing in production use by end-users (customers).

   Trust in automation is what enables continuous deployment directly into production.

   Quick movement into production is one of many steps where
   action can stagnate.

## 16. Change acceleration

   Automation described above <strong>accelerate</strong> what 
   people can do manually. Such is measured by how quickly
   changes go from concept through various environments and
   finally into production.

   "fail fast" ???

   "recover fast" ???

   This enables <strong>business agility</strong> -- 
   the ability to respond more quickly to 
   changes in market forces and customer needs.

   Organizations that move quicker than its competitors are at
   a significant, fundamental competitive advantage.
