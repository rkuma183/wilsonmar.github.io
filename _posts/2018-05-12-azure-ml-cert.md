Here are materials I've come across for learning enough to pass Microsoft's 
Azure Machine Learning certification exam <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-774.aspx">70-774</a> 
- 37 questions in 90 minutes at a VUE center for $165.

This is one way to demonstrate your expertise in making use of  machine learning and Big Data with R Server and SQL R Services within the Microsoft Azure cloud, that you have a good understanding of Azure data services and are familiar with common data science processes such as filtering and transforming data sets, model estimation, and model evaluation. Candidates for this exam should have experience publishing effective APIs for knowledge intelligence.

## Exam Reference Book

The 70-7734 exam began beta on Feb 17, 2017.
The 336 page reference book for the exam was published Feb 2018. 
It is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/exam-ref-70-774-perform-cloud-data-science-with-azure-9781509307012">
$32 from Microsoft</a>, but <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/70-774-Perform-Science-Machine-Learning-ebook/dp/B07B263ZVP/">
$17.27 on Kindle</a>. 

PROTIP: In September 2017 "Studio" was added to the name "Azure Machine Learning" when referring to the web tool. This fixes a confusion in terminology between a tool versus a process.
References in this website reflect that change.

The authors - <a target="_blank" href="https://www.desertislesql.com/wordpress1/?p=2028">
Ginger Grant</a>, Julio Granados, Guillermo Fern√°ndez, Pau Sempere, Javier Torrenteras
also wrote the book on 70-773.

### MCSA Bundle 

Since Machine Learning often involves processing a lot of data, passing this exam as well as "Exam 70-773: Analyzing Big Data with Microsoft R" <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-773.aspx">70-773</a> gets you an MCSA: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/mcsa-machine-learning.aspx">"Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate: Machine Learning certification"</a>.
