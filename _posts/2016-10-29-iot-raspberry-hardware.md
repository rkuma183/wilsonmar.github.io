## Basics

0. Raspberry Pi 3 B+ $35

   The Raspberry Pi 3 has a 1.2 GHz quad-core ARMv8 chip with 1 GB of RAM.

   <amp-img alt="iot raspberry_pi3_2 500x302 69kb.jpg" width="500" height="302" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14143059/19865119/8a5470e6-9f60-11e6-8f62-e58f44c4f14c.jpg"></amp-img>

0. Risers on the board so its metal doesn't touch the table.
   Or a static-resistent mat to put a naked board.

   <a name="HeatSink"></a>

0. Heat sink and fan for disspating heat better when seated on top of the CPU chip 

   PROTIP: Running above 80 degrees F shortens life of the board.
   In data centers, for every 50 kW of power fed to an aisle of server, 
   the same facilities typically apply 100-150 kW of cooling.

   PROTIP: <a href="#BoardTemp">Measure board temperature over time.</a>
   The little alumininum heat sink reduces heat by 2 degrees F.
   Get a large heatsink and fan from an old desktop computer.
   The larger the sink the better.
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AYGnw6MwFM">
   30 degrees cooler</a> with a large copper sink on
   held in place by a clear plastic layer.
   The sink sits on top of a 3 mill copper plate on top of the chip.
   Attach using Artic MX-4 thermal compound.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfQMLInuwws">
   45 degrees</a> using a
   Molex connector used by the fan is powered by a box that may be hard to find now.
   It's loud.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7cc4eLAOMk">
   Water cooling</a>

   Pi 3’s thermal governor (see later) does not appear to be active, 
   leading to an inherently unstable, overheating machine.


0. Micro SD card (8+ GB, up to 32 GB), class 10.
   <strong>Several of them</strong>, for backup and as a base to build others.

   PROTIP: Windows 10 IoT does not support class 4 SD cards.
   An SD card's "class" rating refers to its sustained write speed.
   A class 4 card writes at 4MB/s (4 megabytes per second).
   A class 10 card writes at 10M/s,
   achievedPhotographers prefer SD cards with a class 10 rating because to them
   Get a large heatsink from an old desktop computer.
    at the cost of read speed and increased seek times.
   fast write speed is more important.

   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AYGnw6MwFM
   PROTIP: This is the same one used on many smart phones and cameras.
   So <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mklibrary.com/technology/best-microsd-cards-2016/">
   this detailed analysis with benchmarks</a> 
   from a photographer is useful. The ones from Costco are a good buy:
   SanDisk Ultra MicroSDHC 32GB UHS-I Class 10 Memory Card With Adapter (Upto 80mbps Speed).

   <!-- https://www.sdcard.org/consumers/choices/file_system/index.html#cards-for-pcs -->
   <amp-img alt="sd backwards-compatibility 556x304.gif" width="556" height="304" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14143059/19836547/6b602a38-9e69-11e6-857c-c0e6ac586dbf.gif"></amp-img><br /><br />

   Devices reading the cards must be made to accept larger capacity chips.
   But can accept smaller capacities.
   SDHC (Secure Digital High Capacity of 4GB to 32GB).<br />
   SHXC (Secure Digital eXtended Capacity of 64GB to 
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.micro-sdxc.com/">
   2TB</a>)

   Cheap SD cards may not last long.

   PROTIP: There is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/">
   SD card containing pre-installed NOOBS</a> (New Out Of Box Software)
   promoted as "the easiest to work with".

   But this tutorial focuses on industrial-grade components for 
   maximum flexibility, power, and security.

0. 32 GB of disk space on a Mac or Windows machine.

   The size of hard disk drives have similar issues as SD drives.

   Windows operating systems can format drives using NTFS rather than FAT32.

   Natively Mac OSX does not know how to read NTFS drives.

0. DVD blank disk (R+ or R-) to hold image so as to not use up 
   laptop hard disk space.



   ### Power hardware

0. 2.5A micro-USB 5V DC power - two-prong plug in the US market.

   You can re-use those provided with Android smartphones.

   NOTE: Consumption of electrical voltage is measured in Amprage,
   which draws down voltage.

   Even though US electricity is rated at 120V AC (60 Hz),
   the rating for the plug says 110V - 240V (50 - 60 Hz) so
   a mechanical adapter can use used in other countries.

0. Alternately, the PiPo add-on board draws power from an Ethernet cable,
   so you don't need to buy a micro-USB power supply.

   QUESTION: Can it be combined with a fan?


   ### Not headless

0. HDMI cable connected to a monitor (input selected to the correct HDMI).

0. A special cable - <a target="_blank" href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2881">
   $4.95 from Adafruit</a> connects the 3.5 mm male plug to RCA composite plugs on older TVs.

0. A USB keyboard.


## Off signal button

   Abruptly unplugging the power source can damage the SD card.

   Preferrable is a physical switch that temporarily connects two GPIO pins on the board,
   which a program recognizes and
   sends the proper shutdown command to the operating system software.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1010">
   $5.95 gets you 15 switches</a> to solder.

   A power button (SW4), recovery button (SW2), and Uboot button (SW3)
   is provided by the (now-defunct) organgepi.org.

### Compiled C option

0. Navigate to 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GPIO-Halt">
   Adafruit's C program code</a> and compile the native program on the board.

   <pre><strong>
   cd Adafruit-GPIO-Halt
   make
   sudo make install
   </strong></pre>

0. Copy the <strong>gpio-halt</strong> executable file to folder:

   <pre>
   sudo cp gpio-halt  /usr/local/bin/
   </pre>

   That folder is also where ansible and easy_install are stored.

0. Use a text editor to open the device boot-up configuration file:

   <pre><strong>
   sudo nano /etc/rc.local
   </strong></pre>

0. Cursor to just before final “exit 0” line, insert this line:

   <pre>
   /usr/local/bin/gpio-halt 21 &amp;
   </pre>

   Change the 21 (port number) to 
   whatever GPIO pin your shutdown button is connected to --
   see <a href="#GPIO">GPIO pins</a>.


### Python option

   A Python program running in the background is started using this command: 

   <pre><strong>
   rpi-shutdown-button.py &amp;
   </strong></pre>

   To have it execute automatically upon restart, move the script to folder:

   `/storage/.config/autostart.sh`

   It has a dependency which requires installation to
   within `/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages`:

   sudo pip install -U RPi.GPIO

   <a name="GPIO"></a>

### GPIO pins on headers

   <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.adafruit.com/dotstar-pi-painter/raspberry-pi-setup">
   <img alt="iot rpi pins gpio v01-575x459.png" width="575" height="459" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/20675663/4de84984-b54a-11e6-911f-40b46db5e03b.png"></a>  

   Physical pins are numbered in pairs, starting from 3.3V and 5V at 1 and 2.
   Pins marked in red provide (output) power via wires to devices.
   There are 5V pins in positions 2 and 4.
   Generally, older sensors and actuators tend to use 5V, 
   whereas newer ones use 3.3V in positions 1 and 17.

   DNC means "Do Not Connect".

   CAUTION: 
   Connecting two 5V pins together (at the edge of the board) 
   destroys the board.

   On older Pi 2 A models have a shorter <strong>26-pin</strong> header.
   Newer Pi 3 B+ models have 40 pins.

   Broadcom, the maker of the chip,
   defined GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) pin numbers 
   in its library for software code to listen for connections between a
   physical pin with a <strong>ground</strong> pin (marked GND in black).
   Ground pins are always 6, 9, 14, 20, 30, 39.

   DotStar is used by 
   <a target="_start" href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-dotstar-leds/overview">
   Adafruit's 5V LED light strips</a>

   The program listening for shutdown default to two pins next to each other:
   GPIO 21 (pin 40) with GND pin 39. Alternately, on older boards, the program would listen for
   GPIO 7 (pin 26) with GND pin 25 because that pin is next to the ground (GND) pin.

   The connection can be made with anything conductive (such as a 
   metal paperclip, sissors, or flat screwdriver).
   There are wires and switches made to connect.

   https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-dotstar-leds/overview

### Physical Button

   But a physical button is more user-friendly and safer.

   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-Raspberry-Pi-Shutdown-Button/">
   PROTIP: Salvage from old PC tower cases their physical button, wires, and pin plugs:
   <img alt="iot pc switch salvage-650x324-196kb" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/20641060/bd2fdaea-b3ac-11e6-987d-669643466549.jpg"></a>

   QUESTION: Put a 1K resistor to positive?

   PROTIP: If you are using a wire to connect the switch,
   set the program to listen on <strong>GPIO 17</strong> (pin 11)
   because that pin is 
   soley a GPIO pin and does not double up as something else.
   This may be more reliable.


## Enclosures

   Case (enclosure) that accomodates <a href="#HeatSink">heat dissipation contraptions</a>.

## On-board Camera

   The CSI (Camera Serial Interface) Type-2 connector (next to the HDMI)
   received video one-way to the Broadcom BCM2835 processor on the Pi.
   via a ZIF 15 ribbon cable.

   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.petervis.com/Raspberry_PI/Raspberry_Pi_CSI/Raspberry_Pi_CSI_Camera_Module.html">
   <img alt="iot-csi-zif-cable-411x180" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/20623692/0a99a7da-b2c6-11e6-9846-47a643f9839b.png"></a>

   The CSI interface was developed by the MIPI Alliance and
   is common to almost all Android mobile phones.
   MIPI CSI-2 version 1.01 supports up to four data lanes, where each lane has a maximum of 1 Gbps bandwidth, to provide a total bandwidth of 4 Gbps. 

   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mcmelectronics.com/product/28-21441">
   A $25 NoIR Camera V2</a> is IR sensitive for low-light situations.
   Its 8MP Sony image sensor takes 3280 x 2464 pixel images and 
   captures video at 1080p30, 720p60 and 640x480p90 resolutions. 


## Powered USB 2.0 hub.

   USB provides power as well as provide a conduit for communicating data,
   but for USB devices drawing more than 100 mA, voltage drops.

   USB 1.1 standards offers a theoretical maximum signaling rate of<br />
   12 MB/s over 4 wires using up to 500mA.<br />
   USB 2.0 standards offers a theoretical maximum signaling rate of<br />
   480 MB/s over 4 wires using up to 500mA.<br />
   USB 3.0 has two asychronous unidirectional data paths for max. rate of<br />
   5 GB/s over 9 wires using up to 900mA.
   It's 10x faster due to its blue color. (OK I'm kidding)<br />
   USB 3.1 "SUPERSPEED" was released in 2014.

0. USB hard drive provides extra storage.
   convenient to easily add photos, videos, or other media the Pi displays.

   The Passport drive has 250 GB.

   Western Digital's "WD PiDrive" is available in kit form that includes cables and an enclosure.
   The 314 Gbyte drive retails at $45.81.
   They also have a 1 Terabyte version.
   The WD PiDrive kit includes a 4-headed "hydra cable" for 
   connecting the Raspberry Pi’s two USB ports
   (one for power and the other provides access to the drive).

   It supports the http://www.berryterminal.com/doku.php/berryboot
   loader.

   <a target="_blank" href="">
   $24.99 USB 2.0 to SATA Converter Stackable Expansion Board
   from Ableconn</a> (Taiwan)
   connects SATA drives to the Pi.
   The drive requires a 300 Watt <strong>ATX power supply</strong> for the drive
   from an old PC tower case:<br />
   <a target="_blank" target="iot atx-netzteil 650x477-512kb.jpg" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATX#/media/File:ATX-Netzteil.jpg"><img width="650" height="477" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/20666855/84471ab8-b523-11e6-9d41-c304bc2948ae.jpg"></a>


0. USB to UART serial cable. 
   It's an alternative to using Ethernet and plugging
   a monitor and keyboard into the Pi.
   The USB plugs into laptop or computer.
   The other end plugs into the UART posts on the Pi:
   red = 5V, black = Ground, white = TX, green = RX.

   This powers the board as well, so the Pi doesn't need to be plugged into the wall?
