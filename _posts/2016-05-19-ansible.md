The object of this tutorial is to succintly present, 
with step-by-step instructions but without much marketing hype,
how to make use of Ansible to install software on servers.

## How Ansible works #

<amp-img width="650" height="408" alt="ansible-overview-v02" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/15453893/f9c22a7e-1fe3-11e6-9da7-5ea080789559.jpg"></amp-img>

Ansible's <strong>Control Server</strong> (acs)
communicates with servers to download and provision software locally in them.

The name "ansible" is popularized by the science-fiction book and
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender's_Game_%28film%29"> movie
Enders Game</a>
which uses an "ansible" to communicate, in real-time, with many ships at once,
galaxies away.

One of the distinguishing technologies Ansible uses is the simplicity of it using the
standard <strong>SSH</strong> (secure shell) protocol 
built into all Linux distributions. <a target="_blank" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384426(v=vs.85).aspx">Windows Remote Management (WinRM)</a> is used to connect with Windows (from Vista SP1 or Windows 2008 R1 and up).

   So one does not need to beg for special ports to be opened through the enterprise firewall,
   which one needs to do with Chef and Puppet.

By default, <strong>JSON messages</strong>
are communicated back to the Control Server's API listening on standard port 80.
Internally, Ansible uses the Django-REST framework, <strong>PyYAML</strong>.

   But <strong>plug-ins</strong> can be installed so Ansible can communicate via 
   ZeroMQ "fireball mode" or other means.


### .yml files in Git vs. database #

Instead of a database server, 
Ansible stores declarations in text files of 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html">
<strong>yml</strong> (yamil) format</a>
that are both human and machine readable.

These <strong>Playbooks</strong>
can be edited by any <strong>text editor</strong>.

Playbooks from others are available as 
<strong>roles</strong> in the
<a target="_blank" href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/explore#/">
Ansible Galaxy</a> community website.

Being text files, most enterprises put Ansible configuration files in a
<strong>Git repository</strong> (such as GitHub or Bitbucket) 
to maintain back versions for the team.

<strong>Modules</strong> do the work within the server are invoked by
<a href="#Tasks">tasks</a> specified in <strong>plays</strong>.

Modules can apply plays on several servers defined in an 
<a href="#InventoryFile">inventory</a> file
which can be dynamically generated from an enterprise CMDB (Configuration Management DataBase)
cataloguing assets in AWS, Azure, GCP, or private cloud.

Additional modules can be defined, 
such as for building assets within AWS using CloudFormation.

<a target="_blank" href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/list_of_windows_modules.html">
Windows modules</a> include win_feature (to installs and uninstall Windows Features) and 
win_regedit (Add, Edit, or Remove Registry Keys and Values). WinRM python module

To recap:

<amp-img width="650" height="408" alt="ansible-overview-v02" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/15453893/f9c22a7e-1fe3-11e6-9da7-5ea080789559.jpg"></amp-img>

Let's look at a playbook with full annotations:

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://gist.github.com/wilsonmar/f75a8f192504a7acee5c21c574612a61">
   Insanely complete Ansible playbook, showing off all the options</a>

Ansible works under the concept of "idempotance", where repeated executions of the same script
results in the same state at the end of each run. If something doesn't exist, it is created.
If something does exist already, it is left alone and another isn't created.

Ansible reads declarations of <strong>desired state</strong> (what is wanted after processing)
rather than imperative programming commands (to do this and that in a specified sequence).

   This is like when you get in a taxi and you provide a destination address rather than directions to that location.

   This makes definitions more reusable.



## Windows

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/examples/scripts/ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1">This yaml file</a> launches the hello.ps1 PowerShell script:

   <pre>
- name: Run Powershell Scripts
  hosts: test
  tasks:
    - name: run a powershell script
      script: scripts/hello.ps1
      register: out
    - debug: var=out
   </pre>

The script:

   https://github.com/dstamen/Ansible/tree/master/ansible_powershell

See http://davidstamen.com/ansible/using-ansible-to-run-powershell-scripts/

To execute the script, run:

   <tt><strong>ansible-playbook powershell.yml -i hosts
   </strong></tt>

### Ansible with Cloud Formation #

Yan Kurniawan's
book 
provides Ansible playbook these procedural examples:

   * vpc_create.yml
   * sg_empty.yml to create empty security groups.
   * sg_modify.yml to modify security groups for each type of server
   * sg_delete.yml
   * ec2_vpc_web_create.yml to launch an instance in a particular subnet
   * ec2_vpc_db_create.yml  without assigning a public IP address
   * nat_launch.yml to launch a "staging_nat" paravirtual t1.micro instance (with AMI name that includes "amzn-ami-vpc-nat")
   * vpc_delete.yml
   * vpc_create_multi_az.yml
   * sg_jumpbox.yml
   * ec2_vpc_jumpbox.yml to launch  jump box instance in public subnet A
   * ansible -i ec2.py tag_class_jumpbox -m ping
   * sg_openvpn.yml still requires manual retrieval of the AMI ID on 
    https://openvpn.net/index.php/access-server/docs.html

The book provides an Ansible module in library/vpc_lookup

   * an update of https://github.com/edx/configuration/blob/master/playbooks/library/vpc_lookup
   (from John Jarvis)
   to lookup a VPC or subnets ID stored in local (safe) folder
   based on a particular filter specified in a script.

The suggested hashtag for the book is 
<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=#ansible4aws">Tweet #ansible4aws</a>.

PROTIP: Disable host key checking in ssh configuration so ssh will automatically add new host keys to the user known hosts files without asking (the default is “ask”). 

   * Disable host key checking with StrictHostKeyChecking set to "no" in /etc/ssh/ssh_config file.

### View sample configurations #

0. Use an internet browser to open
<a target="_blank" href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/explore#/">
galaxy.ansible.com/explore</a>

0. Search.

0. Open a sample playbook.

   Playbooks are defined in .yml files, which begin with three dashes in the first line.

   Playbooks define <strong>plays</strong>. consisting of one or a set of <a href="#Tasks">tasks</a>.

   <strong>tasks</strong> invoke modules.

   Tasks trigger <a href="#handlers">handlers</a> which are run on some condition, such as once at the end of plays.

   Spaces after dashes and colons are required.

An Ansible Config define Ansible control server configuration.

Notice the repos downloaded more than anyone is from
@geerlingguy, Jeff Geerling (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.jeffgeerling.com/">jeffgeerling.com</a>)
has been contributing to Ansible community since early 2013, and
wrote <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ansiblefordevops.com/">ansiblefordevops.com</a>.

Encrypted data within playbooks stored in GitHub can be unencrypted in memory using
<a target="_blank" href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_vault.html">
Ansible Vault</a>.


## Roles #

<a target="_blank" href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks-roles.html">
Role files</a> encapsulate instructions on how do a discrete unit of work, such as building a webserver.
A role file contains for each type of resource
<a href="#Tasks">tasks</a>, variables, configuration templates, etc.

<pre>
acme/
  webserver/
    README.md
    defaults/
    files/
    handlers/
    meta/main.yml
    tasks/
    templates/
    tests/
    vars/
</pre>

The main.yml in meta defines dependencies:

{% highlight text %}

  - { role: username.iptables, open_port: 80 }
{% endhighlight %}


## On Linux, not Windows #

Ansible Control Server core is written in Python 2.6+ (not 3.0).
Thus, it can run natively on *NIX (Linux/Unix/Mac) - Windows not currently supported nor recommended.

However, run virtual instances on a Windows, Mac, or other native OS
if you want to use them to run Ansible.


### Setup Vagrant and Virtualbox #

0. Download and install:

   * A virtual image manager from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vagrantUp.com/">VagrantUp.com</a> (87.9 MB for vagrant_1.8.1.dmg).
   * A vm provider (hypervisor) to run virtual machines from Oracle's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">
    VirtualBox</a>

    &nbsp;

0. Verify availability from a command-line Terminal:

   <tt><strong>
   vagrant<br />
   vboxmanager
   </strong></tt>

0. Create a folder (of any name) for Ansible configuration files.
   This is typically for a project.
   This can be in a git folder if you'd like version management.

   <tt><strong>
   cd ~<br />
   mkdir ansible<br />
   cd ansible
   </strong></tt>

   The ~ (tilde character above) refers to your home folder.

0. Switch to an internet browser to open a repository of Vagrant server base images:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vagrantcloud.com/">
   http://vagrantcloud.com</a>
   (which redirects to a site owned by hashicorp, who owns Vagrant, thus the advert for the Atlas licensed product)

   NOTE: Many enterprises instead use an internal repository.

0. In the box under "Discover Vagrant Boxes", search for <strong>ubuntu</strong> or CentOS, etc.

0. Choose one and copy its text in blue, such as "nrel/CentOS-6.5-x86_64" from contributor nrel or "ubuntu/trusty64".

0. Close down any process making use of port 8080, as that's Vagrant's default port.
   (Jenkins also uses port 8080 by default)

0. Initialize a Vagrantfile for use by Vagrant:

   <tt><strong>vagrant init</strong></tt>

   Sample response:

   <pre>
   A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
   ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
   the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
   `vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.
   </pre>

0. If you have a file named <strong>Vagrantfile</strong> from another source,
   copy it into the folder to replace the file generated.

   Alternately, open a text editor to create a file name <strong>Vagrantfile</strong>
    in end up with this sample content to specific the acs (Ancible Control Server),
   web, and db servers:

   {% highlight text %}
   Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|

     config.vm.define "acs" do |acs|
       acs.vm.box = "nrel/CentOS-6.5-x86_64"
       acs.vm.hostname = "acs"
       acs.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"
     end

     config.vm.define "web" do |web|
       web.vm.box="nrel/CentOS-6.5-x86_64"
       web.vm.hostname = "web"
       web.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.20"
       web.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080
     end

     config.vm.define "db" do |db|
       db.vm.box = "nrel/CentOS-6.5-x86_64"
       db.vm.hostname = "db"
       db.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.30"
     end
   end
  {% endhighlight %}

  The (2) in Vagrant.configure(2) configures the configuration version.

  Names between \| (pipe) characters provide handles to identify each server.

  Two spaces are used to indent.

  Internal IP addresses (192.168.33.xxx) are used in this example.

  Change 8080 to another port if it is already used by another process on your computer.


<a name="VagrantUp"></a>

### Vagrant up #

0. Navigate to a folder containing a Vagrantfile specification file.
0. Bring up a machine based on the Vagrantfile in the folder:

   <tt><strong>vagrant up
   </strong></tt>

   This can take several minutes 
   if this is the first time, since images for servers specified need to be downloaded.


0. Switch to a Finder to see that a <strong>.vagrant</strong> (hidden) folder has been added.
   Under the <strong>machines</strong> folder is a folder for each type specified between pipe characters (acs, web, db, etc).

0. Open another terminal shell to check what is running:

   <tt><strong>
   vboxmanage list runningvms
   </strong></tt>

   The response is are hashes:

   {% highlight text %}
   "ansible_acs_1463860205025_4852" {128ce450-8384-4adb-a4fd-7f4ac5c1f0b8}
   "ansible_web_1463862332570_44406" {dd044db3-ecf1-4b9b-9c42-96952172bd4d}
   "ansible_db_1463882256962_22323" {411c8704-f220-4188-8b94-d1bfb093e1b4}
   {% endhighlight %}


<a name="AnsibleServer"></a>

### Provision Ansible Control Server #

0. SSH into the acs server via vagrant:

   <tt><strong>vagrant ssh acs</strong></tt>

   This takes several seconds to connect.

   This adds the ey to the known_hosts file within the .ssh folder for future reference.

0. When you're done:

   <tt><strong>
   exit
   </strong></tt>

0. Use a package manager to download bits. On a CentOS or RHEL server:

   <tt><strong>sudo yum -y install ansible</strong></tt>

   Alternately, on a Debian Ubuntu server:

   <tt><strong>sudo apt-get -y install ansible</strong></tt>

   Notice the log says Python is installed as well.

0. Verify:

   <tt><strong>ansible \-\-version</strong></tt>


   ### Provision web server #

0. SSH into the web server via vagrant:

   <tt><strong>vagrant ssh web</strong></tt>

0. Use a package manager to download bits:

   <tt><strong>sudo yum -y install epel-release</strong></tt>


### Install by Compiling Source Code #

0. Install the C compiler used with Python:

   <tt><strong>sudo yum install gcc</strong></tt>

   <tt><strong>sudo yum install python-setuptools</strong></tt>

   <tt><strong>sudo easy_install pip</strong></tt>

   <tt><strong>sudo yum install python-devel</strong></tt>

   <tt><strong>sudo pip install ansible</strong></tt>


<a name="Tasks"></a>

## Tasks #

Ansible <strong>tasks</strong> are commands executed from command line terminals.

Tasks are shereable and repeatable.


### Steps Modules do #

   0. Gather facts on hosts into variables such as ansible_os_family.
   0. Fetch md5 checksum from remote to verify downloaded file
   0. Create and manage local users and groups
   0. Enable and disable OS features and preferences

   0. Fetch files from remote sites
   0. Install software (web server, app server, database, virus scanner, etc.)
   0. Update software security patches

   0. Copy app configurations
   0. Copy files into server
   0. Call databases to retrieve data

   0. Enable service to start on reboot
   0. Start web service
   0. Deploy load balancer configurations (put in or take out server on rotation)



## Install sample environment #

Install:


Ansible covers more functionality:

   * Provisioning - install software, patch security, copy files in, customize configurations, start web service.
   * Change management of configurations with configuration remediation.
   * Automation - make decisions. A single change can impact several machines.
   * Complex Orchestration of dependencies.

Ansible evaluates to mark changed states.

A function is "idempotent" if repeated applications has the same affect as a single application.


<a name="InventoryFile"></a>

### Inventory file #

An example:

   <pre>
   [webservers]
   192.168.33.20
   192.168.33.30

   [db]
   db-a.example.com

   [lbservers]
   lbserver

   [monitoring]
   nagios
   </pre>

To get the status of servers under [webservers] in the inventory file above:

   <tt><strong>
   ansible webservers -m ping
   </strong></tt>


In addition to this ad-hoc run, Ansible can be run based on the contents of Playbooks with a command such as:

   <tt><strong>
   ansible-playbook <em>file.yml</em>
   </strong></tt>

Add \-v for more detailed response.


<a name="AnsibleTower"></a>

## Ansible Tower for more #

Additionally, licensed product <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ansible.com/tower">
Ansible Tower</a>
runs playbooks for enterprises.

Next, let's look at examples of some Ansible playbook files.


<a name="Modules"></a>

### Modules in various languages #

Unlike Puppet, Ansible does not require <strong>agent software</strong> to be installed and
thus potentially leave residual bits on servers.

Modules are the "brains" of Ansible.

Various <strong>modules</strong> running on remote hosts
provide the plumbing for other networking protocols, such as HTTP, runing on remote machines.

<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/modules_by_category.html">
List of available modules</a>, or locally:

   <tt><strong>ansible-doc -l</strong></tt>

   Press q to quit list, cursor up/down individual line, or space bar to page down.

Responses returned to the Ansible Control Server are in JSON messages.

Modules (hopefully written by following <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/developing_modules.html#testing-modules">
Module Development Guide</a>)
can be selected from various sources:

* <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core">
   ansible-modules-core</a> are writtin Python.

* <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras">
   ansible-modules-extras</a>
   developed by others have slightly lower use or priority.
<br /><br />

Ansible Module development can be in any dynamic language, not just Python on the server.

   * Simplejson library on *NIX.


## Windows support #

Ansible’s native Windows support uses Windows PowerShell remoting to
manage Windows like Windows in the same Ansible agentless way that Ansible manages Linux like Linux.

* Windows Remote PowerShell 2.0 enabled.

* <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/list_of_windows_modules.html">
   Windows modules</a>

   * Push and execute any PowerShell scripts you write


## Playbooks #

Play behavior can be controlled several ways:

   <pre>
   with_items, 
   failed_when, 
   changed_when, 
   until, 
   ignore_errors
   </pre>


### Register Output to Variable #

To capture the result or output of a task so that follow-on tasks can act accordingly:

{% highlight text %}
  tasks:
    - shell: /usr/bin/whoami
      register: username
    - debug: msg="Host={{ inventory_hostname }}, User={{ username }}"
    - file: path=/home/myfile.txt
            owner={{ username }}
{% endhighlight %}


<a name="handlers"></a>

### Conditional Handlers #

An example:

{% highlight text %}
  tasks:
    - name: Deploy configuration file
      template: src=templates/httpd.j2 dest=/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
      notify:
        - Restart Apache
  handlers:
    - name: Restart Apache
      service: name=httpd state=restarted{% endhighlight %}

NOTE: .j2 files are processed by Jinja2, the template engine for Python, which replace variables with data values in static files.

To set a register to put result in a variable, then
if the debug sees that a previous task failed, it would send a message.

{% highlight text %}
  tasks:
    - command: ls /bad/path
      register: result
      ignore_errors: yes

    - debug: msg="Failure!"
      when: result|failed{% endhighlight %}

NOTE: Handlers don't run until all playbook tasks have executed.

{% highlight text %}
  tasks:
    - copy: src=files/httpd.conf
            dest=/etc/httpd/conf/
      notify:
        - Apache Restart
  handlers:
    - name: Apache Restart
      service: name=httpd state=restarted{% endhighlight %}

NOTE: A particular handler only executes once if needed.

NOTE: Handlers don't run until all playbook tasks have executed.


## Config. settings #

The precedence Ansible looks for configuration <strong>variables</strong>.
(stop searching once it finds one):

   0. **$ANSIBLE_CONFIG** environment variable
   0. **./ansible_cfg** in current directory
   0. **~/ansible.cfg** (home directory of currently logged in account)
   0. **/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg** global config. file

An example $ANSIBLE_CONFIG environment variable
<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_configuration.html">
from the full list</a> is:

   <pre>
   $ANSIBLE_FORKS=5
   </pre>

   This sets the maximum number of parallel operations allowed on an Ansible server,
   determined through performance and capacity testing.


## Include files #

{% highlight text %}
  tasks:
    - include: wordpress.yml
      vars:
        sitename: My Site
    - include_vars: variables.yml
{% endhighlight %}

## Rolling updates #

Ansible achieves zero-downtime deployments with
multi-tear rolling updates to each specific node in a cluster.

This specifies taking 5 machines at a time out of a cluster:

   <pre>
   - hosts: webservers
     serial: 5

   pre_tasks:

   - name: take out of load balancer pool
     local_action: command /usr/bin/take_out_of_pool {{ inventory_hostname }}

  roles:
   - common
   - webserver
   - monitored

  post_tasks:
   - name: add back to load balancer pool
     local_action: command /usr/bin/add_back_to_pool {{ inventory_hostname }}
   </pre>


## Popularity #

Ansible is open-sourced under the
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ansible/">
github.com/ansible</a> organization on GitHub.
The repo is among the top 10 Python projects.

The GitHub Octoverse report for 2013 featured Ansible as being #5 on the list of open source projects with the most contributors.

Its documentation is at
