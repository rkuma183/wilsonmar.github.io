This is a DRAFT deep-dive guided tour of how to get setup to begin using Microsoft's various offerings for Machine Learning in their Azure cloud. After this, see use cases:

   * Predictive Maintenance


## Workflows

Regardless of the tool, the workflow for developing intelligent models for predictive analytics revolves around these phases:

1. Business understanding
2. Data acquisition and understanding (establishing Data source, pipeline, envrionment, "wranging" exploration & cleaning)
3. Modeling (Feature Engineering, Model Training, Model Evaluation)
4. Deployment (scoring, performance monitoring)
5. Customer acceptance

These are from Microsoft's <strong>Team Data Science Process (TDSP)</strong> at <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/">https:aka.ms/tdsp</a>.
It's akin to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining">
CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard for Data Mining)</a> and
<a target="_blank" href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining#Process">
KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases)</a>.

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Azure/Azure-TDSP-ProjectTemplate">
https://github.com/Azure/Azure-TDSP-ProjectTemplate</a> sample folder and file names.
* System architecture
* Data dictionaries
* Reports related to data understanding, modeling
* Project management and planning docs
* Information obtained from a business owner or client about the project
* Docs and presentations prepared to share information about the project
<br /><br />

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Azure/Azure-TDSP-ProjectTemplate/blob/master/Docs/Model/FinalReport.md">Microsoft proposes a "Final Report"</a> containing:

## Several interfaces

Microsoft offers several tools for machine learning:

   * Azure Machine Learning Studio, on-line drag and drop interface for creating simpler machine learning workflows. It has limitations about the size of the data that can be handled (about 10gigs of processing).
   * Azure Machine Learning Workbench, downloaded <strong>client GUI/IDE</strong> running on your laptop
   * <a href="#CLI">Azure Machine Learning CLI</a> for running (repeatable) scripts in your local Terminal instead of clicking
   * Azure Machine Learning Experimentation, completely on-line to create models
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.MachineLearningModelManagement">Azure Machine Learning Model Management</a>, on-line to deploy models (after you create models)
   * Azure Machine Learning Compute for Model Management
   * <a href="#DSVM">Data Science Virtual Machine</a>
   * <a href="#HDInsight">HDInsight big data</a>
   * AI Batch that runs multiple jobs in parallel for scale
   <br /><br />

PROTIP: One has to traverse three different web sites to design, deploy, and consume Machine Learning.

![aml-steps-405x156-17814](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/40132203-665cad26-58f9-11e8-9eb8-34076f838a3b.jpg)

Working backwards from the Azure Portal used in production:

1. Visit the Azure Portal Dashboard at<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="
   https://portal.azure.com/">
   https://portal.azure.com</a>
   
   PROTIP: Copy this URL and open up a different internet browser (such as Chrome, Firfox, Brave) so that you can tab between them easier.

   <!-- ![azure-ai-offerings-415x396-27423](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/39999744-209d8336-5747-11e8-8773-bc5f88733be2.jpg)
   -->

2. If you've already created a "Machine Learning Experiment", click here</a>
   Otherwise, click "+ Create a Resource" in the top left menu:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/hub">
   <img align="right" alt="azure-resource-list-210x529-22177" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/40260563-fa98acec-5ac0-11e8-9599-eaa18accfa58.jpg"></a>

   AI and Machine Learning projects usually involve several of these "Azure Marketplace" items.

3. Click "AI + Machine Learning" to see the scope of sophistication Microsoft has achieved.

   NOTE: "Data Science Virtual Machine - Windows 2016" is not included in the list to
   <a target="_blank" href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/microsoft-ads.windows-data-science-vmwindows2016">
   Create virtual machine</a>

4. At the top next to the "Featured" heading, click "See all", notice Microsoft's categorizes:

   * Machine Learning (below)
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.githhub.io/chatbots/">Bot Service</a>
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.githhub.io/cntk/">Cognitive Service</a> (which provides AI services for speech, vision, text analytics, search, etc.). Microsoft previously referenced them under acronmy CNTK (CogNitive ToolKit).

   The above list are links to separate article/page for each category.

   TBD: The "Machine Learning Model Management" 

5. Click "Machine Learning Experimentation", which was in "preview" at the time of writing.

   If you don't have an Experiment account, you are prompted for one.

   ![azure-ml-ex-1-278x410-25903](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/40262848-c6ca5fd6-5ad0-11e8-80a0-7285a7256206.jpg)

   BTW This is similar to <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb">Google's Colaboratory</a>,
   free to use on-line <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/">Python Jupyter Notebooks</a> that stores data in Google Drive and <a target="_blank" href="https://research.google.com/colaboratory/local-runtimes.html">can run locally</a>.

6. The Experiment Name has is a maximum of 32 characters. It says the only special character allowed is the dash (but it didn't reject underlines) to separate words.

7. PROTIP: Define a naming convention for your <strong>Resource Groups</strong> 
   which your team will follow for consistency, to avoid confusion.

8. For Location, in the US there is "East US 2" and "West Central US".

9. The "seats" (developer) is how it's charged, with the first 2 free.

1. Create a new Storage account if you haven't already. This is to store tracked execution output.

   ![azure-ml-ex-2-278x352-25479](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/40262852-d2dbc684-5ad0-11e8-8d42-12997c1374c1.jpg)

   NOTE: A Visual Studio Team Service account for version-controlling your project using a Git repo.

1. Your Model Mangement account name can be up to 260 characters.

1. Select "DEVTEST" for Model Management account fee type. The types:

   ![manage-acct-types-727x189-40314](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/40262379-8bc6b5b4-5acc-11e8-9fb6-83669780fbc9.jpg)

   PROTIP: Together here are Per day and Per month fees from the <a target="_blank" href="   https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/machine-learning-services/">Pricing FAQ</a>

   <table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
   <tr valign="bottom" align="right"><th> Plan </th><th> S1 </th><th> S2 </th><th> S3 </th></tr>
   <tr valign="top" align="right"><td>Per day: </td><td>$1.60</td><td>$12.08</td><td>$80.63</td></tr>
   <tr valign="top" align="right"><td>Per month:</td><td>$50</td><td>$375</td><td>$2,500</td></tr>
   </table>

   31 days per month.

1. Check "Pin to dashboard".

1. Click "Automation options" to expose the parameters file for the selections above.

1. Click "Download" to save the "template.zip" file to your laptop for use in CLI calls.

   PROTIP: The files downloaded in the zip enable you to <strong>quickly re-create</strong>
   the manual selections you took above. This enables you to save money by re-creating on demand rather than paying for unused services lingering around racking up charges.

1. Click the "CLI" tab for the Bash (deploy.sh) script to make use of the parameter file.
1. Click the "PowerShell" tab for the deploy.ps1 script.
1. Click the ".NET" tab for the DeploymentHelper.cs programming code.
1. Click the "Ruby" tab for the deployer.rb file.
1. Click "Create". Wait for the completion pop-up in your account's Dashboard.
1. Click "See more" at the bottom of the "All resources" pane. This is because you may not see the item you just created.
1. Click the Machine Learning Experimentation you just created.

   ### Install local Workbench
   
   QUESTION: Is there a brew formula for this?

1. In a Machine Learning Experimentation page, click "Azure Machine Learning Workbench" for your operating system (Mac file AmlWorkbenchSetup.dmg or Windows).

   You come back to this page above after you timeout.

   PROTIP: With the free account, SQL database access is not allowed, so stay with .csv files.

   Alternately, if you want to use your own data (up to 10GB), click "Sign-in".

0. Click the "hamberger menu" at the upper left.

   ![azure-ml-top-menu-430x198-16945](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/39979174-075583f0-5702-11e8-9249-b794675d5491.jpg)

   Selecting <strong>Cortana Intelligence</strong> takes you to the "Azure AI" marketing page at <br />
   <a target="_blank" href="
   https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/ai-platform/">
   https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/ai-platform</a>

   BTW There is also a marketing page at <br /><a target="_blank" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/">
   https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning</a>

0. Click the "hamberger menu" at the upper left again and<br />
   click "Gallery" to look at examples in <a target="_blank" href="https://gallery.azure.ai/">
   https://gallery.azure.ai</a> titled "Azure AI Gallery" (previously called the Cortana Intelligence Gallery at gallery.azureml.net).

   PROTIP: There is not many views to an item, so you're one of the early adopter visionaries!

   ### Solutions

   The menu item on the menu named 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://gallery.azure.ai/solutions/">
   Solutions</a> applies to usage by a particular customer/industry.
   
   An example of a solution is the <a target="_blank" href="https://gallery.azure.ai/Solution/Interactive-Price-Analytics">
   Interactive Price Analytics</a> applying models (studied in "Micro Economics" courses)
   that are the basis for recommending pricing changes based on the history of 
   how demand for particular products responds to prices changes.

   Solutions are not a selection in ML Studio because they make use of models derived
   from experiments in the ML Studio:
   Modeling Price Elasticity - Part 1: Own-Price-Elasticity, Parts
   <a target="_blank" href="https://gallery.azure.ai/Experiment/Modeling-Price-Elasticity-Part-1-Own-Price-Elasticity-1">
   1</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://gallery.azure.ai/Experiment/Modeling-Price-Elasticity-Part-1-Own-Price-Elasticity-2">2</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://gallery.azure.ai/Experiment/Modeling-Price-Elasticity-Part-1-Own-Price-Elasticity-3">and 3</a>.

   ### Projects

1. Within the ML Studio:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://gallery.azure.ai/">
   <img align="right" alt="azure-ml-menu-175x259-10955.jpg" width="175" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/39960539-e0e903ac-55e1-11e8-8b75-3518d4527ca1.jpg"></a>
   Projects, (trained) Models, Experiments, 
   reflect the left menu than the solutions horizonal menu (but in a different order):

   <a target="_blank" href="https://gallery.azure.ai/projects/">PROJECTS</a>
   are in both - collection of scripts, notebooks, and/or data designed to support the everyday work of data scientists.
   
   ### Experiments

   "EXPERIMENTS" construct <strong>workflows</strong> using a sequence of techniques on data.
   See https://gallery.azure.ai/experiments 

1. Click "SAMPLES" from Microsoft.

   NOTE: The examples are from June, 2016.

   ### Notebooks

   "NOTEBOOKS" are iPython Notebooks that present an explaination of each Python coding step.

   See the tutorial at https://gallery.azure.ai/Notebook/773ccb4114fa46c99004381bbfa328de

   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio/studio-overview-diagram
   Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio Capabilities Overview

   ### Datasets

   "DATASETS" contain data.

   ### ONNX vs WinML files

   https://gallery.azure.ai/models (.ONNX or .WinML files) for download - to build projects and solutions.

   Most of them are ported from the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/onnx/models">repository of pre-trained machine learning computational graph models</a> in ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format (<a target="_blank" href="https://onnx.ai/">https://onnx.ai</a>), which can run on different deep learning <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/onnx/tutorials">frameworks (Tensorflow, Keras, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, Apache MXNet, Facebook's PyTorch, or Caffe2)</a>.
      
   WinML (Windows Machine Learning)
   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/machine-learning/
   converts ONNX models to execute locally in Windows 10 devices, leveraging GPU Hardware Acceleration on DirectX12.
   WinML converts models in Apple CoreML, scikit-learn (subset of models convertible to ONNX), LibSVM, XGBoost

## Workbench

The steps below are based on <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/desktop-workbench/cli-for-azure-machine-learning">this web page</a>.

https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli
https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/azure-cli/

1. Install the CLI by downloading the <strong>AmlWorkbenchSetup.dmg</strong> file from 

   <a target="_blank" href="https://aka.ms/azureml-wb-dmg">https://aka.ms/azureml-wb-dmg</a>
   
   The CLI for Azure Machine Learning services is different from the Azure CLI used for managing Azure resources. 

   This "Azure Machine Learning Workbench" installer includes CLI.

2. From inside Finder, double-click the .dmg to install.

   BLAH: Use of .dmg file instead of brew means that versions are not managed automatically.

3. Click "Open" to the "... downloaded from the internet" pop-up.

4. Click the blue link "Click here for a full list of dependencies that will be installed".
   The response:
   <pre>

   ### AZ ML CLI 

3. In a Terminal, run this command to install the Machine Learning CLI:

   <pre>pip install -r https://aka.ms/az-ml-o16n-cli-requirements-file
   </pre>

3. In a Terminal, run this command to verify:

   <pre>az ml --help</pre>

   The expected response is:

   <pre>
Group
    az ml: Module to access Machine Learning commands.
&nbsp;
Subgroups:
    account : Manage operationalization accounts.
    env     : Manage compute environments.
    image   : Manage operationalization images.
    manifest: Manage operationalization manifests.
    model   : Manage operationalization models.
    service : Manage operationalized services.
   </pre>

   However, installation did not go well if the response is instead:

   <pre>
az: error: argument _command_package: invalid choice: ml
   </pre>

   To attach a <a target="_blank" href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/microsoft-ads.linux-data-science-vm-ubuntu">Data Science VM</a> target (remotedocker):

   <pre>
   TARGET_NAME="wow2"
   TARGET_ADDR="dsvmtd6eqpmmla6ly4c.westcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com" # or FQDN
   AZ_USERNAME="dsvm"
   AZ_PASSWORD="Dsvm@6eqpmmla"
   az ml computetarget attach remotedocker \
      -n "$TARGET_NAME" -a "$TARGET_ADDR" \
      -u "$AZ_USERNAME" -w "$AZ_PASSWORD"
   </pre>

   PROTIP: For better security, define AZ_USERNAME and AZ_PASSWORD in a separate shell file.

   To attach an HDInsight target:​

   <pre>
   CLUSTER_NAME="myhdicluster-ssh.azurehdinsight.net"
   az ml computetarget attach cluster \
      -n "$TARGET_NAME" -a "$CLUSTER_NAME" \
      -u "$USERNAME" -w "$PASSWORD"
   </pre>

   Within the aml_config folder, you can change the conda dependencies.

   Also, you can operate with PySpark, Python, or Python in a GPU DSVM.

## Deploy to production

See https://services.azureml.net/ and https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio/model-progression-experiment-to-web-service

1. Click <a target="_blank" href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.MachineLearningModelManagement">
    Create Microsoft Machine Learning Model Management</a>

   NOTE: You can not select the "DEVTEST" pricing tier to use for deployment.

From the Overview section:

In order to deploy and manage models in production, you need to create a machine learning compute environment.

First, set up a virtual environment - you only need to do this once for your subscription:

    In the Azure portal, click the Cloud Shell button on the menu in the upper-right of the Azure portal.

    In Cloud Shell, create a virtual environment:
   <pre>
   virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 <em>my-project-path</em>
   </pre>

    Add the following lines to ~/.bashrc:<br />
    export PATH="<em>my-project-path</em>/bin":$PATH
    export PYTHONPATH="<em>my-project-path</em>/bin"

    Run:<br />
    source ~/.bashrc

    Install Azure CLI in the virtual environment:<br />
    <pre><em>my-project-path</em>/bin/pip install azure-cli</pre>

    Install Azure ML CLI also:<br />
    <pre><em>my-project-path</em>/bin/pip install azure-cli-ml</pre>

    Alternately, get tested versions with:
    <pre>pip install -r https://aka.ms/az-ml-o16n-cli-requirements-file</pre>

    After installation, <tt>find / -name azure-cli-ml 2>/dev/null</tt>
    to reveal location installed:
    <pre>~/Library/Caches/AmlWorkbench/Python/az-extensions/azure-cli-ml</pre>

After you have set up the virtual environment once, use the following steps every time you need to set up and configure a compute environment for deploying and managing models:

    Create a remote compute environment - you will be prompted to login and select a subscription:<br />
    <pre>az ml env setup -n <em>compute-environment-name</em> \
       -l <em>location-of-the-environment-resources</em> \
       [-g <em>name-of-a-new-or-existing-resource-group</em>] \
       -c</pre>

    To see if your environment is ready to be used, run the below command.<br />
    <pre>az ml env show -g <em>resource-group-name</em> -n <em>compute-environment-name</em></pre>

    Once provisioning is complete, set the compute environment where you want to deploy services:<br />
    <pre>az ml env set -g <em>resource-group-name</em> -n <em>compute-environment-name</em></pre>
