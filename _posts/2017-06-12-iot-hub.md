Here is a hands-on step-by-step introduction to Microsoft's IoT Hub.

IoT Hub runs in Microsoft's Azure cloud, one of
[several IoT clouds I've looked at](/iot-clouds/).

0. Open an Azure Subscription:

   After a one-month free trial period, the "F1 Free Tier" provides
   each month 8,000 free messages (of .5 KB each) a day.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/iot-hub/"> 
   The first paid tier</a> of
   400,000 messages per month / $50 = 0.000125 per message (about 1 cent).

   TODO: A Bash/PowerShell script that does all the below.



   <a name="HubExplorer"></a>

   ### IoT Hub Explorer

   The iothub-explorer is a CLI tool for managing device identities in your IoT hub registry, send and receive messages and files from your devices, and monitor your IoT hub operations.

   The iothub-explorer tool also lets you simulate a device connected to your IoT hub.

   To get started with iothub-explorer using the Visual Studio Code command line:

0. Install Node.js
0. Install the latest version from any folder:

   <pre><strong>npm install iothub-explorer -g
   </strong></pre>

0. Verify by getting a menu:

   <pre><strong>iothub-explorer --help
   </strong></pre>

0. PROTIP: Edit on your Mac's boot-up file:

   <pre><strong>source ~/.bash_profile
   </strong></pre>

0. Add this line to create a custom alias, then save the file:

   <pre>alias aih='iothub-explorer'</pre>

   NOTE: You can select another alias short name than this example.

0. Close your Terminal and open it again or, alternately:

   <pre><strong>source ~/.bash_profile
   </strong></pre>

0. Now you can verify using an alias:

   <pre><strong>aih --version
   </strong></pre>


   ### Device Explorer app for IoT Hub devices

   Use the Device Explorer tool (on Windows 10 only) to manage devices connecting to your IoT hub. For example, you can use this tool to register a device with your IoT hub, monitor messages from your devices, and send messages to your devices. This is not the same as the Device Explorer blade that you can open from your IoT Hub service on the Azure portal.

   The Device Explorer app runs on your local machine and connects to your IoT hub in Azure. 
   It communicates with the following IoT Hub endpoints:

   * Device identity management to provision and manage devices registered with your IoT hub.

   * Receive device-to-cloud to enable you to monitor messages sent from your device to your IoT hub.

   * Send cloud-to-device to enable you to send messages to your devices from your IoT hub.

   ### Create a device

   az iot hub create --resource-group <em>your-RG</em> --name <em>yourname</em> --location <em>yourlocation</em>

   NOTE: Location is also called region.

   ### Delete a device

   <pre><strong>az iot hub delete --name <em>yourname</em> --resource-group <em>yourRG</em> 
   </strong></pre>

   ### List devices

   <pre><strong>az iot device -h
   </strong></pre>


   ### Create an IoT Hub service

0. Clone an <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-sdks">Azure IoT service SDK</a> 

   WARNING: These repos contain <strong>sub-modules</strong>, so add to git clone commands
   <strong>`--recursive`</strong>. 

   PROTIP: Since we won't be uploading changes, we don't fork and we also add to the command
   <strong>`--depth=1`</strong>. 

   * https://github.com/azure/azure-iot-sdk-python (2.7 and 3.5) - 195 M -
   <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/VlK24lfMWfM">Video</a>

   * https://github.com/azure/azure-iot-sdk-node - 45 M -
   <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/VlK24lfMWfM">Video</a>

   * https://github.com/azure/azure-iot-sdk-java (1.7+) - 49 M -

   * https://github.com/azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp (C#) for .NET and UWP (Universal Windows Platform) - 57 M -

   * https://github.com/azure/azure-iot-sdk-c for microcontrollers such as RTOS - 60M - 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/vf2sW3wZjds">Video</a>

   PROTIP: The smallest is Node.

0. NOTE: The rest of this tutorial uses Python, so:

   <pre><strong>cd azure-iot-sdk-python
   </strong></pre>

0. PROTIP: See how much disk space is used by the new folder. On a Mac:

   <pre><strong>du -sh
   </strong></pre>

   For Python I got `155 M` (Megabytes) using `--depth=1` versus `195 M` with all history.

0. PROTIP: In the future, to obtain changes to the repo by Microsoft:

   <pre><strong>git pull
   </strong></pre>

   The Azure IoT Hub service provides the device-to-cloud and cloud-to-device messaging capabilities and acts as the gateway to the cloud and the other key IoT Suite services. The service enables you to receive messages from your devices at scale, and send commands to your devices. 

   The service also enables you to manage your devices. For example, you can configure, reboot, or perform a factory reset on one or more devices connected to the hub.

   ### IoT Suuite

   The Hub service is core to the Azure IoT Suite.

   See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messaging

## Azure IoT Gateways

   The simple version <a href="#[2]">[2]</a>:<br />
   ![iot-azure-arch-650x348-75kb](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/27012436-ae360686-4e9d-11e7-94c0-e63215de7a5e.png)

   Raspberry Pi's can communicate using these directly supported protocols:

   * HTTP (synchronous waits)
   * AMQP (asychrononous but heavy feature set)
   * MQTT (lower overhead and simpler, but less feature rich, less secure) - 256 bytes or it's a file upload/download.
   <br /><br />

   ### Stream Analytics 

   Azure Stream Analytics provides "in-motion" data analysis. IoT Suite uses this service to process incoming telemetry, perform aggregation, and detect events. 

   Preconfigured solutions use stream analytics to process informational messages that contain data such as metadata or command responses from devices. 

   * Remote monitoring (RMsolution) [2:50] 

   https://youtu.be/Tg_RZMXHYj8 by (corywink@microsoft)

   * Predictive Maintenance

   Solutions use Stream Analytics to process the messages from your devices and deliver those messages to other services.

   Create a Stream Analytics job that monitors data received by the IoT Hub.

   ### Routing to functions

   Azure Functions are small chunks of code invoked based on a trigger
   that's paid for only when it's running vs.
   Stream Analytics 

   C#, F#, Node.js, Python, PHP, batch, bash, or any executable.

   It connects to many services, such as send an email when a sensor reading exceeds a configured threshold value.

   ### Create a Cosmos DB storage account 

   * Use an Azure Stream Analytics (SA) query job to store telemetry data then make it available for analysis. 

   Azure blog Storage and Azure Cosmos DB provide a pre-configured solution to store telemetry 

   Azure Cosmos DB stores device metadata and enables device management.

   Video: Device Management</a> lifecycle:

   1. Plan
   2. Provision
   3. Configure
   4. Monitor
   5. Retire


   ### Job

0. In Azure, create a new job.

   Query: 

   <pre>SELECT * INTO blob FROM iotmva</pre>

0. Add Output.

   Storage options:

   * Azure SQL Database can be used as an output for data that is relational in nature or for applications that depend on content being hosted in a relational database. Stream Analytics jobs will write to an existing table in an Azure SQL Database. Note that the table schema must exactly match the fields and their types being output from your job. An Azure SQL Data Warehouse can also be specified as an output via the SQL Database output option as well (this is a preview feature).

   * Blog storage offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for storing large amounts of unstructured data in the cloud.

   * Table storage offers highly available, massively scalable storage, so that an application can automatically scale to meet user demand. Table storage is Microsoft‚Äôs NoSQL key/attribute store which one can leverage for structured data with less constraints on the schema. Azure Table storage can be used to store data for persistence and efficient retrieval.


   * DocumentDB (shown in the EDX course)

   * Data Lake Store stores data of any size, type and ingestion speed for operational and exploratory analytics. Stream Analytics needs to be authorized to access the Data Lake Store.
   <br /><br />

   * Event hub s a highly scalable publish-subscribe event ingestor. It can collect millions of events per second. One use of an Event Hub as output is when the output of a Stream Analytics job inputs into another streaming job.

   * Service bus Topics provide a one-to-many form of communication.
   While Service Bus Queues.

   * Service Bus Queues provide a one to one communication method from sender to receiver with a First In, First Out (FIFO) message delivery. Typically, messages are expected to be received and processed by the receivers in the temporal order in which they were added to the queue, and each message is received and processed by only one message consumer.

   * Azure Cosmos DB is a fully-managed NoSQL document database service that offers query and transactions over schema-free data, predictable and reliable performance, and rapid development.


   ### Power BI Visualization

   Power BI can be used as an output for a Stream Analytics job to provide for a rich visualization experience of analysis results. This capability can be used for operational dashboards, report generation, and metric driven reporting.

   Azure Web Apps and Microsoft Power BI provide data visualization capabilities. 

   The flexibility of Power BI enables you to quickly build your own interactive dashboards that use IoT Suite data.
