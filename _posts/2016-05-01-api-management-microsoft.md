{% include _toc.html %}

Microsoft on Azure is one of several [API management/governance vendors I evaluated](/api-management-evaluation/).

"Publish, manage, secure, and analyze your APIs in minutes"
is Microsoft's tag line at
<a target="_blank" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/">
Microsoft's API Management home page</a> (Service Overview).

Microsoft's service is based on its October 23, 2013
acquisition of APIphany (based in Wash. DC).

<a target="_blank" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/api-management-get-started/">Documentation</a>
is published from markup text
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-content/blob/master/articles/api-management/api-management-get-started.md">in a GitHub</a>
which directs people to the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://manage.windowsazure.com/@jetbloomhotmail.onmicrosoft.com#Workspaces/ApiManagementExtension/services"> classic portal
at manage.windowsazure.com</a> rather than the newer
<a target="_blank" href="https://portal.azure.com/">
portal.azure.com</a> site using Azure Resource Manager (ARM).

   NOTE: There is no Issues tab in their GitHub.

* The roadmap is not public.

* <a target="_blank" href="https://feedback.azure.com/forums/248703-api-management?filter=top&page=1">
   Issues with the API service</a>
   where each public can allocate 25 voting points among proposals.

   The top request (May 2016) is 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2015/09/04/introducing-microsoft-asp-net-webhooks-preview/">
   Web Hooks in ASP.NET</a>, 
   a <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.asp.net/projects/aspnetwebhooks/en/latest/">
   set of Nuget packages</a>
   for web apps to send and receive WebHooks from external services using a common HTTP pattern. 
   http://neelbhatt2015.blogspot.in/2015/12/webhooks-in-aspnet-visual-studio.html
   This won’t get the scale, performance, or analytics Azure Event Hubs provides, though.

* <a target="_blank" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/api-management/">
  The pricing page</a> states there is no on-premises deployment option available at this time.

### Swagger import 

A Swagger 2.0 doc can be imported, but the doc MUST contain Host, BasePath, Schemes properties. Otherwise, it won't get imported:
No message. It just hangs with "working..". 

### Analytics:

In the Summary graph, detail for a point in time can be obtained with mouse-over:

<img src="https://acom.azurecomcdn.net/80C57D/cdn/mediahandler/docarticles/dpsmedia-prod/azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/api-management-get-started/20160415071221/api-management-mouse-over.png">

   * Response time (in ms)
   * Bandwidth usage KB
   * Successful? Popular === Volume of <strong>calls</strong>.
   * <strong>Errors</strong> === Number of calls blocked due to limits?

   Notice the pre-defined filters for Today, yesterday, Last 7 Days,
   Last 30 Days, Last 90 Days


<img src="https://acom.azurecomcdn.net/80C57D/cdn/mediahandler/docarticles/dpsmedia-prod/azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/api-management-get-started/20160415071221/api-management-analytics-overview.png">

   Activity chart provides reports that drill down on the specific activity by developer, product, API, and operation.

What about:

   * Specific translations performed
   * Specific policies violated
   * metrics by geography
   * Correlation of two metrics (response time vs bandwidth scattergram)

   * Issues over time

## App Fabric Instead

Build your own.

<a target="_blank" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/service-fabric/">
Microsoft Service Fabric</a> (in GA April 2016)
has
<a target="_blank" href="http://tryazureservicefabric.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/">
several free "party" clusters</a> that last for less than 4 hours each.

Service Fabric programming model focus on: 
 
 * Reliable Actors, 
 * Reliable Services, 
 * custom application orchestration, and 
 * Service Fabric management tasks.

In order to build and run Azure Service Fabric applications on your development machine, 
you need to install the runtime, SDK, and tools. 
You also need to enable execution of the Windows PowerShell 3.0 scripts included in the SDK.

To use Service Fabric PowerShell cmdlets on Windows 7, 
which includes Windows PowerShell 2.0 by default, 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=50395">
download the Windows Management Framework 5.0 which includes PowerShell 3.0</a> as well as
Desired State Configuration (DSC), Windows Remote Management (WinRM), Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).
See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=717903 

The Party Cluster is created by code at 
https://github.com/Azure-Samples/service-fabric-dotnet-management-party-cluster

Not AzurePS

The local cluster manager :

"C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Service Fabric\Tools\ServiceFabricLocalClusterManager\ServiceFabricLocalClusterManager.exe"

Pin this to the taskbar.

Microsoft Service Fabric is about more than API management.
Its features and patterns for application development, including:

0.    Stateful Reliable Services with Reliable Collections.
0.    Dependency injection and unit testing with Reliable Services.
0.    How to use Service Fabric configuration packages, both the built-in Settings.xml config and custom JSON configuration, with rolling updates without restarting services.
0.    How to encrypt sensitive data in Service Fabric configuration packages.
0.    Inter-service communication using the Service Fabric remoting stack.
0.    Diagnostics with Elastic Search through ETW event sources.
0.    How to write a stateless Web API front-end service.
