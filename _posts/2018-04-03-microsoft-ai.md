This article provides a guided tour of use Microsoft's AI (Artificial Intelligence) offerings, which include Machine / Deep Learning capabilities running on the Azure cloud.

## History

In 2014, Microsoft showed off its facial recognition capabilities with
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.how-old.net/">how-old.net</a>
to guess how old someone is. At conferences they built a booth that takes a picture.

In 2015, Microsoft unleashed the Tay chat bot, then had to bring it down after hackers submitted enough racial slurs that they fooled the system into thinking that was normal and acceptable. 

In April 2018 Microsoft reorganized into two divisions that offers AI:

* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/machine-learning-edge/">
The research division</a>, headed by Harry Shum, is putting AI into Bing search, Cortana voice recognition and text-to-speech, ambient computing, and robotics.

* With the "computing fabric" led by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/guthriescott/">Scott Guthrie</a>, makes AI services available for those building customizable machine learning with speech, language, vision, and knowledge services. Tools offered include Cognitive Services and Bot Framework, deep-learning tools like Azure Machine Learning, Visual Studio Code Tools for AI, and Cognitive Toolkit.

Microsoft's Azure IoT Edge (at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Azure/ai-toolkit-iot-edge"> https://github.com/Azure/ai-toolkit-iot-edge</a>) brings AI and machine learning to the edge of networks, such as in the field and on factory floors. See the <a target="_blank" href="https://gallery.azure.ai/Solution/IoT-Edge-2">Sample app</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/azure/en-US/home?forum=MachineLearning">read all the unanswered forum posts</a>

## Project Brainwave

At Build 2018, Microsoft announced <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/serving-dnns-real-time-datacenter-scale-project-brainwave/">Project Brainwave</a> to run Google's Tensorflow AI code and Facebook's Caffe2, and Microsoft's <a href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/CNTK/">Cognitive Toolkit</a>. 

[<a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/serving-dnns-real-time-datacenter-scale-project-brainwave/">
This pdf</a> white paper says the "high-performance, precision-adaptable FPGA soft processor is at the heart of the system, achieving up to 39.5 TFLOPs of effective performance at Batch 1 on a state-of-the-art Intel Stratix 10 FPGA."
Microsoft's use of field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) calculates AI reportedly "five times faster than Google's TPU hardware".

"Each FPGA operates in-line between the serverâ€™s network interface card (NIC) and the top-of-rack (TOR) switch, enabling in-situ processing of network packets and point-to-point connectivity between hundreds of thousands of FPGAs at low latency (two microseconds per switch hop, one-way)."

Documentation on CNTK is at <a target="_blank" href="
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/index">
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/index</a>

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/brainscript-basic-concepts
BrainScript uses a C-like syntax that is aimed at allowing to express neural networks in a way that looks like math formulas. BrainScript is dynamically typed.

Brainscript has a <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/BrainScript-and-Python-Performance-Profiler">
Performance Profiler</a> that can be enabled.

Hyper-parameters are a separate module (alongside Network and reader) 
to perform SGD (stochastic-gradient descent).
