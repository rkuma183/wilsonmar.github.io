Understanding the trend of numbers over time is a fundamental skill.
That's why it's taught in elementary school. Why?

> "Those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it." -- Edmund Burke

## Excellence defined

Below are vizualizations that have the following traits:

 * Dynamic data - update visualizations (in "live mode") as data changes in sources such as databases. 
 
 * Visual querying -  change the query by selecting or clicking on a portion of the graph or chart (to drill down, for example). 
 
 * Linked multi-dimensional visualization - selections made in one chart are reflected as you navigate into other charts.
 
 * Animation -   

 PROTIP: Dynamic (movie mode) is available only within the Tableau Public client,
 not when viewed on websites (as of 2016-01-05).
 
 * Personalization - give power users an in-depth view and newbies a simpler view, and also control access to data based on user- and role-based access privileges.
  
 * Actionable alerts  -  thresholds and parameters that trigger messages whether you're interacting with reports or not.

  an internet legend for his
  <a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/18477762">

  In them he shows his 
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gapminder.org/world-offline/">
  Gapminder web app</a> which
  presents multiple dimensions dynamically over time (nearly 300).

## Time Series databases

<a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/213631101">
Introduction to Time Series</a>

* KDB proprietary runs in-memory within a single machine.

* Graphite - legacy invented by Expedia - does automatic roll-ups of data (losing irregular values)

* RiakTS from Basho is built for scale

* Promethius for DevOps (highly available with scaleout?)

* OpenTSDB is a layer on top of HBase.

* TimescaleDB, an open source time-series database engineered from PostgreSQL, 

* [InfluxDB - my notes](/influxdb/), open-source (MIT)

   * No external dependencies (written in Go)
   * SQL-like query language
   * Input data "Line Format" (not JSON)
   * Stores data in compressed format
   * Horizontally scaleable (across several servers)
   * Kapacitor collects anomalies
   <br /><br />

* Microsoft Azure introduced in 2017 their
