Understanding metrics over time is a fundamental skill.

> "Those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it." -- Edmund Burke

## Excellence defined

Below are charts that posess traits of excellent visualizations:

 * Dynamic data - update visualizations (in "live mode") as data changes in sources such as databases. 
 
 * Visual querying -  change the query by selecting or clicking on a portion of the graph or chart (to drill down, for example). 
 
 * Linked multi-dimensional visualization - selections made in one chart are reflected as you navigate into other charts.
 
 * Animation -   

 PROTIP: Dynamic (movie mode) is available only within the Tableau Public client,
 not when viewed on websites (as of 2016-01-05).
 
 * Personalization - give power users an in-depth view and newbies a simpler view, and also control access to data based on user- and role-based access privileges.
  
 * Actionable alerts  -  thresholds and parameters that trigger messages whether you're interacting with reports or not.

  an internet legend for his

  In them he shows his 
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gapminder.org/world-offline/">
  Gapminder web app</a> which
  presents multiple dimensions dynamically over time (nearly 300).
