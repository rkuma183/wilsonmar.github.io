## Valuable Insights
Get <strong>hands-on</strong> experience using the latest versions of the most popular DevSecOps tools, all working together, end-to-end, in a set of servers in the cloud each participant controls.

The "Sec" part of "DevSecOps" means security, which include scans of code for vulnerabilities, use of certificates to control access, and tools to manage secrets using secure vaults.

The hands-on approach enables participants to truly gain important insights into the benefits and trade-offs related to agile test automation. 

This is a "guided tour" to show how the <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/ci-cd">21 groups of DevOps technologies</a> work together in a <strong>toolchain</strong> that builds and deploy software: Git, Maven/Yarn, Nexus, Jenkins, Vault, SonarQube, Selenium, Ansible, etc. 

## Who Should Attend
This course is for anyone new to DevOps. No specific prerequisites are assumed, and all technical concepts are explained; however, attendees are expected to have some software and agile knowledge or experience. This course is for testers, programmers, business analysts, and managers who need to see first-hand how DevOps works.

## Editions of the course
There are several editions of this class:

* The <strong>half-day introduction</strong> provides an understanding of key DevSecOps terms and concepts possible only from seeing it all working together. Participants edit a file, push it to GitHub, and see a whole series of programs build and test software automatically. Participants leave with an appreciation for the subtleties of each technology and a plan for proactive action.

* The <strong>full-day experience</strong> has you generating both application code and the whole DevOps toolchain for an architecture that automatically scales. You then <strong>re-build the whole setup</strong> after making configuration changes. Participants leave with a visceral understanding of both the advantages and limitations modern DevOps offers.

* The <strong>two-day immersion</strong> enables you to see code moving through <strong>multiple environments</strong> from development servers to production clusters. This is crucial for people who work in corporate enterprises. Participants leave after a live "blue/green" deployment. NBD

## Shift left
The traditional approach of performance testing only before final release to production means that potentially major risks and technical debt can remain hidden. Here is how organizations make performance testing and engineering "shift-left" earlier in the software development lifecycle.

To ensure quality at speed, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scaledagileframework.com/system-demo/">System Demos</a> by Agile software developers at the end of each two or three week sprint must now include automated performance status. 

## Unique 
Only this course provides participants a full set of <strong>dozens of cloud-based servers</strong> to work on during the class. Here you get the equivalent to several years of on-the-job experience.
