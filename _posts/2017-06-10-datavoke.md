## Technology architecture

Create the data structure, business logic and user interface all in the same environment utilized by the end user. Implement end user feedback in near real-time. 

      "Unlike some solutions that generate code that must be maintained after the deployment of the application, with DataVoke, you never have to work through code. Not while building. Not while maintaining, Not ever."

"It's the next-generation Wordpress."

## Competitors

   * Typeform

   * IronSpeed (which patent trolls shut down)

## Getting Started

1. Sign-up for a license at http://www.datavoke.com/sign-up-for-free/
0. Invoke your custom sub-domain URL and password from the email.

0. Favorite the URL in your browser so you can get back to it quicker.

0. Check "Remember Me" and "Stay Logged In", then click SIGN IN.

0. PROTIP: Type your given password again on the first field
   before using 1Password to generate a new password.

   WARNING: 1Password does not recognize the need for a new
   account to be saved here. So open 1Password and
   manually create an entry before generating the password.

   In the Datavoke app:

0. Enable pop-ups before clicking "DataVoke Community".

   Alternately, click these URLs:

   | Name | URL |
   | ---- | --- |
   | Forums | <a target="_blank" href="https://datavoke.zendesk.com/forums">https://datavoke.zendesk.com/forums</a> |
   | Help | <a target="_blank" href="https://datavoke.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/">https://datavoke.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/</a> |
   | Submit Ticket | <a target="_blank" href="https://datavoke.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">https://datavoke.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new</a> |

   These are specified inside the 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://support.datavoke.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002371346-Startup">gear icon</a> on the left menu.

0. Switch to another browser tab to
   Sign-up for Support at https://support.datavoke.com/hc/en-us

   That page has a menu of information (hotkeys, etc.)

0. Optionally change the start-up screen by 
   clicking the gear on the left menu.

   WARNING: Because the software is currently in Beta, menu icons can and will change since the video was recorded and since this picture was taken:

0. Press <a target="_blank" href="https://support.datavoke.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002294886-DataVoke-Hotkeys"> Hot keys</a> to reach
   each of the menu buttons from the keyboard, without a mouse.

0. Click on "Sample" to see the end result of the sample app created
   in the tutorial.

0. PROTIP: If you have several monitors, on one screeen view the
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJI3tiYvDk0&list=PLj_wYwoisibpHGMdAhI42P-inLj2e_lr8">
   Getting Started vidoes on YouTube</a>,
   This helps you avoid the on-screen pop-ups.

0. Put the video on full screen and 1080p resolution 
   so you can see the detail.

0. PROTIP: Use different browsers so that you can 
   flip back and forth quickly using keys Command+Tab on Macs or Command+Esc on Windows.

0. On another screen, read <a target="_blank" href="https://support.datavoke.com/hc/en-us/sections/201820846-Getting-Started">
   text notes and screen element pictures</a> 
   that fly by in the video.
   
0. Download the data file mentioned in the video from ???

   ## Views

   In DataVoke, hidden views perform calculations and update records in the background on a scale not seen by the user.

   * Background Views - _background - ViewName
   * Analysis Views - _analysis - ViewName
   * Dropdown Views - _dropdown - FunctionName
   * Related Views - Parent View Title: Related View Name

   Action chains

   Areas for variables


## Datavoke's GUI Technologies

   * "App Space" is the application.

   * Layers

   * HTML5 canvas


## Ideas for Roadmap

1) Instructions to create a typical sample app
   that pulls in APIs (Tasks from Google, etc.)
   after negotiating OAuth2.

2) Have pre-populated data in known drop-down fields such as 
   country, city, state, etc.

4) Sample Selenium scripts for functional testing.

5) Read a sample JSON or, better yet, Swagger or GraphQL file 
   and generate a client application. 
   Then I can edit the UI.

6) Re-Generate the Swagger spec based on changes in the UI.

7) Workflow?

8) Translation among languages (French for Canadians, 
   Chinese for a hugh market, etc.)

9) Mobile hybrid PWA Progressive Web App that stores data locally

10) Input data from IoT devices.

11) Have rock-star UI designers create custom UI skins I can buy.
