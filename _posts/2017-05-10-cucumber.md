{% include _toc.html %}

Cucumber is an open-source server program that tests applications based on 
specification of that system's features (behavior) written in the "Gherkin" language.

Cucumber is often used for what some call "User Acceptance Testing" (UAT) to 
determine if the system built should be accepted by users. 

The cucumber server can be started using a command such as:

   <pre>
cucumber -f pretty -f html -o report.html
   </pre>

<a target="_blank" href=".com/gkushang/cucumber-html-reporter">
NOTE</a>: An example of cucumber's HTML output:

In the US, green is used on street lights to indicate "pass". Cucumbers are green. Thus the name of the software. Gherkins are small pickled cucumbers.

## Business features

PROTIP: Defining a full scope of features enables features to have a better naming conventions.

Examples of functions are:

* Login admin for admin menu.
* Create user (registration).
* Login user.
* Logout.
* Password recovery.
* Delete account.

* Share photos or videos.
* Send a friend request.
* Approve requests.

Additionally, each feature may have some error recovery features.

PROTIP: It's better NOT to include the name of the app under test as part of the feature name
in order to make the files more reusable with other apps.

PROTIP: Identify negative test cases (those designed to fail in order to test error handling).

## Gherkin language

The Gherkin language is designed to be a "natural" (English-like readable) language 
designed to be understandable by business people (unlike coding in 
Java, Go, Python, etc. which are written for reading by specially trained programmers.)

Gherkin code can be editted with any text editor.

<a target="_blank" hrer="http://www.agiletrailblazers.com/blog/the-5-step-guide-for-selenium-cucumber-and-gherkin">An example</a> 
of a feature file (with .feature file suffix) which describes a single feature:

   <pre>
# language: en
Feature: Site Search
Scenario:
  Given We navigate to the homepage
  When We search for the word agile
  Then The results for the search will be displayed
  Examples:
    |foo|
    |bar|
   </pre>

The Gherkin language is simple. It doesn't require matching parentheses and semicolons at the end of each line.

Indentation is used to define structure. Like Python and Bash files,
pound signs are read as comments and not parsed.

The sample above does not need to begin with a language specification because English is the default. Gherkin can be written in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Spoken-languages">60 languages</a>.
Feature files using the Norwegian language ("no") begin with "Egenskap" instead of "Feature" in a header line:

   <pre>
# language: no
Egenskap: Summering
   </pre>

Each feature can consists of one or more scenarios.
Each scenario consists of <strong>steps</strong> specified by
"Given", "When", and "Then" keywords.

Rules of Gherkin "Treetop" grammar are defined in the Gherkin language standard at 
, see <a target="_blank" href="
https://cucumber.io/docs/reference">
https://cucumber.io/docs/reference</a>

Some call the Gherkin code "living" specifications because there is an automated way to keep specifications in sync with what the system created.

Thus, Cucumber bridges the "communication gap between domain experts and developers".
Cucumber enables text about what business people require to be executed as tests.

The behavior desired by a system are defined by Gherkin specifications that are executable.

Alternately, some testing utilities (such as est.ai, testim.ai, etc.)
<strong>create Gherkin</strong> by automatically scanning apps to identify page objects.


### Capybara

Capybara is the part of Cucumber that acts like a user on a web browser.
It is for "integration testing".
The Rails tools simulates how a user would interact with a website.
Capybara puts applications "through its paces" by simulating a user and browser performing the steps of the scenarios -- interacting with the app to receive pages, parse the HTML, and submit forms, just as a real user would.  


By storing features in files along with different scenarios of feature use composed of many steps, and storing Ruby code in separate files containing step definitions that tests each type of step, Cucumber and Capybara automatically test the behavior of the SaaS app.


## Execution

Gherkin is used for "Black box testing" where the person executing the test does not get into the internal engineering of the app.

The <strong>Gherkin interpreter</strong> reads text written like spoken language. 

When the Gherkin interpreter encounters a keyword such as "navigate" and "search", 
Cucumber looks into a subdirectory specifically called "step_definitions".

Feature files can be executed by several software testing platforms:

   * Ruby on Rails
   * Selenium (Java)
   * PicoContainer
   * Spring Framework
   * Watir for Ruby and WatiN for dot Net

See https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin


## Installation

There is a Bash script that installs the various Cucumber modules on a Mac:

   <a target="_blank" href="
   https://github.com/wilsonmar/mac-setup">
   https://github.com/wilsonmar/mac-setup</a>

Cucumber consists of a set of software modules. 
When "cucumber" is specified among TEST_TOOLS, several modules need to be installed with it.

Selenium

mvn

### Different execution frameworks

Execution frameworks provide assertions and verifications.
Assertions determine whether each step succeeded.
Verifications determine whether ???

### Modules to run

   <pre>
./script_name.sh features/registration.feature --format html --expand 
   </pre>

The arguments specify what features are run, referenced by the "$@" below:

   <pre>
#!/bin/sh
bundle install
rake db:migrate
rake db:test:prepare
rake cucumber "$@"
   </pre>

Many Agile teams have embraced use of Gherkin language in a Behavior Driven Development (BDD) approach to software development.

<a name="BDDWorkflow"></a>

### BDD workflow

Because Gherkin is a language common to both business people and technical programmers,
those who know what needs to occur and developers who write programs, 

BDD is focused on what to test, <strong>not how</strong> to test.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwLhR9RI3ew">
PROTIP</a>: A key part of BDD is the <strong>collaborative</strong> discussion among the stakeholders rather than silos not talking with each other.

![cucumber-bdd-545x412-54158](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/32413680-bdce9b7a-c1e4-11e7-9257-b518e865f680.jpg)

BDD works at a higher level than unit tests of the TDD (Test Driven Development) approach to software creation. As with TDD, the BDD approach builds software <em>incrementally</em>, by writing feature files that fail before writing code that makes the tests pass.
In fact, it is an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thinkcode.se/blog/2016/06/22/cucumber-antipatterns">anti-pattern</a> to write Gherkin after the software.

The "driven" part of BDD means that business people can specify what the computer should do in a way that can be actually verified. It's more rigorous that the traditional approach of writing "requirements" documents (in Microsoft Word).

The team has a mechanism to define and verify what "done" really means.

This is a big time saver to business people because the automation enables everything previously defined to be verified again and again after even the most misicule of changes. 
This enables agility with quality.

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/graze/cucumber-rest-bdd/blob/master/STEPS.md">
THIS</a> presents a good comparison between Behavioral and Functional statements (which reference HTTP codes).

When specs are automatically (Cucumber, etc.), specifications remain up-to-date.

<a target="_blank" href="https://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/">Dan North</a> (<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/tastapod">@tastapod</a> in London UK) and Liz Keogh created a BDD framework, JBehave,[1] followed by a story-level BDD framework for Ruby called RBehave[9] which was later integrated into the RSpec project. https://relishapp.com/rspec
The group also worked with David Chelimsky, Aslak Hellesøy (<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/aslak_hellesoy">@aslak_hellesoy</a> Norwegian in London), and others on "The RSpec Book: Behaviour Driven Development with RSpec, Cucumber, and Friends". The first story-based framework in RSpec was later replaced by Cucumber mainly developed by Aslak Hellesøy. 

Other frameworks include JBehave, JDave, Easyb, etc.

## SpecFlow for .NET

SpecFlow is Cucumber for .NET environments. To install the SpecFlow.Nunit package, see 
Jason Roberts (@RobertsJason) 
<a target="_blank" href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/automated-acceptance-testing-specflow-gherkin/table-of-contents">
Automated Acceptance Testing with SpecFlow and Gherkin</a> for Visual Studio and C# coding [2:51] 28 Oct 2013

## Step definitions

The mapping between each step of the scenario defined in the Gherkin feature file 
and the code of each function to be executed is defined in steps definition file stores.

   <pre>
public void goToFacebook() { 
   driver = new FirefoxDriver(); 
   driver.navigate().to("https://www.facebook.com/"); 
} 
@When "^user logs in using Username as \"([^\"]*)\" and Password as \"([^\"]*)\"$"
public void I_enter_Username_as_and_Password_as(String arg1, String arg2) {
   driver.findElement(By.id("email")).sendKeys(arg1);
   driver.findElement(By.id("pass")).sendKeys(arg2);
   driver.findElement(By.id("u_0_v")).click(); 
} 
@Then"^login should be unsuccessful$" 
public void validateRelogin() { 
   if(driver.getCurrentUrl().equalsIgnoreCase(
      "https://www.facebook.com/login.php?login_attempt=1&lwv=110")){ 
         System.out.println("Test Pass");
   } else { 
      System.out.println("Test Failed"); 
   } 
   driver.close(); 
}
   </pre>


@When "^user logs in using Username as \"([^\"]*)\" and Password as \"([^\"]*)\"$"

## Annotations to avoid duplicates

Under src/test/java, create an "outline.feature" file such as:

   <pre>
Feature: annotation 
#This is how background can be used to eliminate duplicate steps 
&nbsp;
Background: 
   User navigates to Facebook Given 
   I am on Facebook login page 
&nbsp;
#Scenario with AND 
Scenario: 
   When I enter username as "TOM"
   And I enter password as "JERRY" 
   Then Login should fail 
&nbsp;
#Scenario with BUT 
Scenario: 
   When I enter username as "TOM" 
   And I enter password as "JERRY" 
   Then Login should fail 
   But Relogin option should be available
   </pre>

## End-to-end

QUESTION: How is Gherkin different than Rules specified in rule-based systems?

* PicoContainer
* Salesforce
* Spring Framework

<a name="Selenium"></a>

### Selenium

How to test is the job of Selenium.

The first line of a Selenium program:
   <pre>
require 'selenium-webdriver'
driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox
   </pre>

Selenium makes use of <strong>webdriver</strong> to control web browsers.

On Windows:

   <pre>
    java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.35.0.jar -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver="D:\dev\chromedriver.exe"
    </pre>

So Selenium is more suited to "end to end" testing, for example with 
<a target="_blank" href="http://nightwatchjs.org/">nightwatch.js</a>.

Karma is a test runner designed for unit tests, so it is much harder to achieve end to end tests on it, you can add a phantomjs launcher, but it is not the same as real browser tests with Selenium. I think both of them can run any js testing framework if you have an adapter... Mocha, jasmine, qunit, etc... 

In Visual Studio, highlight a scenario line and right-click to Generate step definitions.

Mocha is used for unit testing.
It's said that Mocha has better asynchronous support than Jasmine.
Jasmine is used for end-to-end testing.

The JUnit plug-in for Cucumber called "cucumber-html-report" tracks scenarios and steps tested and produces HTML reports.


## Alternatives

Jest, being from Facebook, at https://facebook.github.io/jest/
is focused on JavaScript-based apps built using Facebook's React.


<a name="Install"></a>

## Install Cucumber server

There are several ways to obtain a running instance of Cucumber,
listed from easiest to most difficult:

A) You don't need a local machine if you use the cloud service 

B) <a href="#DockerHub">Pull an image from Docker Hub</a> 
   within a Google Compute or AWS cloud instance.

C) Use the Dockerfile to build your own Docker image containing JMeter.

D) <a href="Homebrew">Use Homebrew to install JMeter natively on you Mac</a>.

E) <a href="#BinaryInstall">Download installer to install locally</a>.

CAUTION: If you are in a large enterprise, confer with your security team before 
installing. They often have a repository such as Artifactory or Nexus where
installers are available after being vetted and perhaps patched
for security vulnerabilities.

<hr />

1. Create within your internal cloud, Google Cloud, Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure, etc.
   a VM instance of an Ubuntu server. 4 GB RAM and 10 GB drive is the minimum.

   A sample command to create a Google Cloud instance:

   <pre>
   gcloud beta compute --project "attiopinfosys" instances create "cucumber-1" --zone "us-central1-f" --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --subnet "default" --maintenance-policy "MIGRATE" --service-account "776279044010-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com" --scopes "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.write","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/monitoring.write","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/servicecontrol","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/service.management.readonly","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/trace.append" --min-cpu-platform "Automatic" --tags "http","https","web","http-server","https-server" --image "ubuntu-1604-xenial-v20171026a" --image-project "ubuntu-os-cloud" --boot-disk-size "10" --boot-disk-type "pd-standard" --boot-disk-device-name "cucumber-1"
   </pre>


   <a name="Dockerfile"></a>

   ### Use Dockerfile to image

1. Install Git and Docker.
2. Run the Dockerfile at 

   <a target="_blank" href="
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wilsonmar/Cucumber/master/Dockerfile">
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wilsonmar/Cucumber/master/Dockerfile</a>

   Its contains:

   <pre>
FROM ubuntu:16.04
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
  default-jre \
  default-jdk \
  git \
  maven 
&nbsp;
RUN mvn -version
RUN git clone https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm.git --depth=1
CMD ls
RUN cd cucumber-jvm/examples/java-calculator --depth=1 && mvn test
   </pre>

   The above provides commands to install Cucumber within a blank Docker container.

   `cucumber-jvm/examples/java-calculator` is a simple sample app, 
   which is replaced with a real app in the real world.



   <a name="DockerHub"></a>

   ### Use Docker image

0. Install Docker.

   <pre>
    docker pull <a target="_blank" href="https://hub.docker.com/r/graze/cucumber-rest-bdd/">graze/cucumber-rest-bdd</a>
   </pre>

0. Run the image:

   <pre>
   docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/opt/src -e endpoint=http://server/ graze/cucumber-rest-bdd
   </pre>



<a name="BinaryInstall"></a>

### Binary install

Cucumber server software was written in the Ruby programming language.
Ruby is the "R" in RSpec, which defines the language grammar.

So Cucumber is supplied as a Ruby gem.

1. Install the Ruby interpreter.

2. Declare that our Ruby app depends on this gem and use Bundler to install it.

   <pre>
   gedit Gemfile
   ... add 'gem
   bundle install
   </pre>


## Feature files

Cucumber executes files named with a <strong>.feature</strong> file extension.

Within that file, the keyword "Feature" is on the first line.


PROTIP: Some teams find it useful to hold a feature brainstorm session to identify as many features as they can think of right away, to get all ideas "on the table" before diving into more detail.

### Tags

The team would then be in a position to assign various tags to group features in order to tease out duplicates and to classify each feature as:

   * @HappyPath
   * @ErrorPath
   * @EdgeCase
   <br /><br />

   Tags are "arbitrary" in that they can be about any category.

   <strong>@ignore</strong> is recognized as a feature not to be executed during testing.

   <strong>@important</strong> 

   <strong>@wip</strong> identify work-in-process that need more attention.

   <strong>@humanexecuted</strong> identify features that are executed manually.

   <strong>@weekly</strong>, @hourly, @daily, @yearly, etc. identify when they are executed.

Other tags, for example:

   * Public (before login)
   * Login Authentication
   * Navigation
   * Purchase
   * Post-sale
   <br /><br />

Ideally, each feature should be independent of and isolated from others.
So a feature can include several <strong>steps</strong> to perform.

The team then can dive into estimating and elaboration.


## Scenarios

Scenarios are examples of expected system behaviors.
Each scenario describes a particular situation that uses the feature.

Sentences not <em>starting</em> with any of these keywords are treated as comment documentation. A fanciful example[1]:

   <pre>
Feature: Brush teeth
   In order to stay pain free
   As a human
   I want to brush my teeth
   </pre>

There are other keywords:

    <strong>Background</strong> provides setup setups common to several scenarios.

       <strong>Given</strong> to set-up initial state

    <strong>Scenario</strong> describes a concrete example illustrating a business rule. It consists of a list of steps.
    
    Scenario Outline
    
    <strong>When</strong> to perform action(s)

    <strong>Then</strong> for the end-state to check

    <strong>And</strong> adds additional items as the keyword above it.

    <strong>But</strong> is a counter-example on undesired side-effects
    
    Background - to avoid repeating givens in all scenarios.
    
    Examples


PROTIP: Instead of English words, French, Japanese, and other words can be used with installation of the target translation.
This is because Gherkin is known as a Domain-Specific-Language (DSL).

## Helpers in IDEs


SpecFlow is an extension installed into Visual Studio. SpecFlow features are

* SpecFlow Feature File
* SpecFlow Hooks (event binding)
* SpecFlow Step Definition


## User stories

A User Story is a low fidelity (inexact) description of a use case.

From https://saascourse.blogspot.com/2012/03/feature-add-med.html

   <pre>
Feature: user can add a medication

Scenario: add a medication
   Given I am on the patient medications screen
   When I follow "add new medication"
   Then I should be on the "New Medication" page
   When I fill in "Med Name" with "Aspirin"
   And I select "Route Oral"
   And I press "Return"
   Then the list of matched medications should be displayed in the list
   And I should see Aspirin Tablets
   </pre>

Steps generally

   * Given
   * Perform action(s)
   * Check end state
   <br /><br />
