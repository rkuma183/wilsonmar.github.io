   The UI is a SPA (Single Page Application) that communicate via HTTP/2 WebSockets to back-end Java Spring microservices. 

   <strong>.ts</strong> file extension is used by the TypeScript compiler which generates JavaScript with .JS extension. Angular 2 does not really use TS extension. With TypeScript you get some options that are not available to you in plain JavaScript. See http://www.typescriptlang.org/

   NOTE: ReactJS is being worked on as
