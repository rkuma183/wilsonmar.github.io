This tutorial is a step-by-step hands-on introduction to use of Terraform to deploy a cluster of web servers and a load balancer on AWS and other providers (clouds).

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.

Repeatable. Versioned. Documented. Automated. Testable. Shareable.

https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html

## Competitors to Terraform

<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.gruntwork.io/why-we-use-terraform-and-not-chef-puppet-ansible-saltstack-or-cloudformation-7989dad2865c#.63ls7fpkq">NOTE</a> Other IAC tools include Chef, Puppet, Ansible, SaltStack, AWS CloudFormation.

Both CF and Terraform work with JSON, but Terraform works with HCL (Hashicorp Configuratio Language) that is both human and machine friendly. https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl and described at https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax.html

But Terraform also provides execution control, iterations, and (perhaps most of all) management of resources already created (desired state configuration) over several cloud providers (not just AWS).


## Installation #

Release 0.6.8 (2.12.2015)

Terraform was written in Golang. ["Read all about it here"](/golang/).

On MacOS:

   <tt><strong>brew install -g terraform
   </strong></tt>

   The response at time of writing:

   <pre>
==> Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/terraform-0.10.6.sierra.bot
######################################################################## 100.0%
==> Pouring terraform-0.10.6.sierra.bottle.tar.gz
==> Caveats
zsh completions have been installed to:
  /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions
==> Summary
üç∫  /usr/local/Cellar/terraform/0.10.6: 7 files, 63.6MB
   </pre>   

   PROTIP: Terraform is written in the [Go language](/golang/), so there is no JVM to download as well.


0. Initialize plug-ins:

   <tt><strong>terraform init
   </strong></tt>

   Response:

   <pre>
Initializing provider plugins...
- Checking for available provider plugins on https://releases.hashicorp.com...
- Downloading plugin for provider "aws" (0.1.4)...   
&nbsp;
The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
so the latest version was installed.
&nbsp;
To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
changes, it is recommended to add version = "..." constraints to the
corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings
suggested below.
&nbsp;
* provider.aws: version = "~> 0.1"
&nbsp;
Terraform has been successfully initialized!
&nbsp;
You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.
&nbsp;
If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
   </pre>

   ### Sample scripts

   Sample scripts have been prepared by several helpful people.

0. Create or navigate to a folder that will house new repositories. For example:

   ~/gits/terraform/gruntwork-io

0. Get a sample repo 

   <tt><strong>git clone <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/intro-to-terraform">
   https://github.com/gruntwork-io/intro-to-terraform.git</a> \-\-depth=1 && cd intro-to-terraform
   </strong></tt>

   At time of writing:

   <pre>
Cloning into 'intro-to-terraform'...
remote: Counting objects: 12, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (12/12), done.
remote: Total 12 (delta 1), reused 9 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (12/12), done.
   </pre>  

0. Navigate into:

   <tt><strong>cd single-web-server
   </strong></tt>

0. Open folder using Atom or list files:

   <tt><strong>ls -al
   </strong></tt>

   PROTIP: There should be only one <strong>main.tf</strong> per folder because Terraform commands look for that first.

   NOTE: Terraform declarative files coded end with <strong>.tf</strong> file type.

   <strong>.tfstate</strong> files (containing JSON) are autogenerated to persist the state of runs. This can also be in a Hasicorp Consul server. Terraform creates a dependency graph (specfically, a Directed Acyclic Graph).
   This is so that nodes are built in the order they are needed. 

   NOTE: State files can contain secrets.

   It also dentifies additions and deletions.

   A lock file is creaetd to prevent other Terraform instances to 

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax.html">
   NOTE</a>: Terraform code is written in a declarative language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language).

0. Edit file <strong>main.tf</strong>. Widen the screen width to avoid wrapping.

   Annotations are as in bash scripts: Single line comments start with # (pound sign).<br />
   Multi-line comments are wrapped between /* and \*/. Values can be interpolated usning syntax wrapped in ${}, such as ${var.foo}. 

0.

   `vars.tf` file contains specifcation of values to variables, such as the server port (8080).

   <pre>
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

variable "server_port" {
  description = "The port the server will use for HTTP requests"
  default = 8080
}
    </pre>

   `outputs.tf` file 

   <pre>
output "public_ip" {
  value = "${aws_instance.example.public_ip}"
}
   </pre>

0. PROTIP: Make sure that the AWS region is what you want.

   https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/instance.html
   AWS provider

   NOTE: The contents of the repo were written based on Terraform 0.7.x.

0. PROTIP: If the AMI is no longer available, you will get an error message.

    <pre>ami = "ami-2d39803a"</pre>



   ### Terraform Plan

0. Have Terrform evaluate based on vars in a different (parent) folder:

   <tt><strong>terraform plan -var-file='..\terraform.tfvars'
   </strong></tt>

   A sample response:

   "&LT;computered>" means Terraform figures it out.


   * terraform.tfstate stored in S3, Atlas, Consul, etcd, HTTP


   ### Version

0. Obtain version installed:

   <tt><strong>terraform version 
   	</strong></tt>

   Alternately:

   <tt><strong>terraform \-\-version 
   	</strong></tt>

   The response at time of writing:

   <pre>
   	Terraform v0.10.6
   </pre>

   QUESTION: Pace of change?

   TODO: Update terraform

   ### AWS Configuration

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=(your access key id)
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=(your secret access key)


   ### Command list

0. For a list of commands:

   <tt><strong>terraform 
   	</strong></tt>

   The response at time of writing:

   <pre>
Usage: terraform [--version] [--help] &LT;command> [args]

   </pre>

  Automating infrastructure deployment consists of:

  * Provisioning resources
  * Planning updates
  * Using source control
  * Reusing templates

  PROTIP: Terrform files are "idempotent" (repeat runs don't change anything if nothing is changed). Thus Terraform defines the "desired state configuration".
