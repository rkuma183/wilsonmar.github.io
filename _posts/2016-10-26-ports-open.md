Here is how to see what ports are open listening on a server.

This is perhaps the most important potential vulnerability.

Having ports listenting to outside traffic also takes a bit of CPU,
which consumes electricity and thus reduce battery life.



<a id="Spotlightz"></a>

## Spotlight on Network Utility to List Ports

Apple's <strong>Spotlight</strong> is like Window's Search omni-box.
<a target="_blank" href="http://osxdaily.com/2014/05/20/port-scanner-mac-network-utility/">
*</a>

0. Press <strong>Command+Spacebar</strong>. 

0. Type the name of utilities that are buried, such as
   <strong>Network Utility</strong>.

0. Click the keyboard return/enter key to launch the Network Utility app.

0. Select the &quot;Port Scan&quot; tab.

0. Enter the IP (such as 127.0.0.1), localhost, or domain name 
   you wish to scan for open ports.

0. Choose <strong>scan</strong> to see what ports the server responds to.



## Mac lsof #

0. In a Terminal command line:

   <pre><strong>lsof -nP +c 15 | grep LISTEN
   </strong></pre>

   PROTIP: If you'll be using this often, create an alias.


   "lsof" is a contraction for "list open files".
   Without any options specifications, lsof lists all open files belonging to all active processes.

   "-nP" is a combination of "n" for no resolution of IPs to hostnames using DNS
   and "P" for no resolution of Port names from numbers.

   This is because the command already takes several seconds to run.

   "+c 15" specifies command width of 15.

   Piping to grep filters out only lines containing "LISTEN".

   NOTE: All options are shown by this command:

   lsof -h

   See http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/08/lsof-command-examples

0. Drag your Terminal window wider to remove word-wrap.

"FD" column lists File Descriptors. "u" is for read and write mode. "r" for read only, "w" for write-only.

Linux requires root on operations for well-known ports below 1024.

Registered Ports: 1024 through 49151.

Dynamic/Private : 49152 through 65535. 

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is the most commonly used protocol on the Internet and any TCP/IP network. TCP enables two hosts to establish a connection and exchange streams of data. TCP guarantees delivery of data and that packets will be delivered in the same order in which they were sent. Guaranteed communication/delivery is the key difference between TCP and UDP on ort 53.

UDP (Datagram Protocol) is connectionless and does not guarantee reliable communication; it's up to the application that received the message to process any errors and verify correct delivery. UDP is often used with time-sensitive applications, such as audio/video streaming, where dropping some packets is preferable to waiting for delayed data. 


## Processes Tour

   NOTE: Drag the scroll bar to see what is beyond what is displayed.

   <pre>
     0t0      TCP 127.0.0.1:27017 (LISTEN)
   </pre>

<strong>mongod</strong> is MongoDB listening on port 27017.

   I should keep that closed unless I need it.

   https://www.mkyong.com/mongodb/mongodb-allow-remote-access/

In Node, close all connections when the app closes completely:

<pre>
process.on('SIGINT', function() {
  mongoose.connection.close(function () {
    console.log('Mongoose disconnected on app termination');
    process.exit(0);
  });
});
</pre>

<strong>2BUA8C4S2C</strong>

   When I search for "2BUA8C4S2C" I see "2BUA8C4S2C.com.agilebits" in folder /Users/mac/Library/Group Containers

   <a target="_blank" href="https://discussions.agilebits.com/discussion/7647/port-6258-whats-going-on">This</a> says
   This port is used only on the <strong>loopback interface (127.0.0.1)</strong> for the 1Password extension to talk to the 1Password Agent. It should be safe to firewall it from any sources other than 127.0.0.1. If you do a packet capture on lo0 and then filter by tcp.port == 6258 you can see what traffic is being passed. Nothing is transmitted in the clear.

<strong>Skype</strong> I don't mind keeping open. I use it a lot.

<strong>Dropbox</strong> - why does it need to be kept open?
  
   I'll use just their web page when I need it.

   See https://www.dropbox.com/help/41

<strong>Resilio\x20Sync</strong> 
I used once to get a file.

   In Resilio Preferences, uncheck â€œStart Resilio Sync on startup".

<strong>SketchMirrorHel</strong>

   XMPP ports 56989 and 56990

0. There are a lot of options

   <tt><strong>
   nmap -h
