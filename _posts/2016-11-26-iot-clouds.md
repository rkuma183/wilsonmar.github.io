This page aims to provide a way to <strong>compare</strong> (in a hands-on way)
the various cloud services catering data from IoT devices.

This assumes that you have absorbed the tutorial about 
[Intel IoT devices](/intel-iot/).

## The list #

   $19 internet-powered moisture senor kit</a>
   that's ideal for classroom experiments.

   The kit requires some assembly on a <strong>breadboard</strong> with loose wires
   which is more complicated but has more options than Grove boards and connectors.
   
   But Losant provides

   documentation</a>.

### Losant Software #

This picks up after XDK is used to create the "Blinking LED" project.

0. Install a local git program and Node (if you haven't already).
0. Open a Terminal shell window to globally install https://github.com/Losant/losant-mqtt-js
   to connect the Edison to the Losant platform.

   npm install -g losant-mqtt

0. PROTIP: Create a "subject" folder where git creates folders during cloning.

0. Edit the package.json file to add dependency: 

  <pre>
  "dependencies": {
    "losant-mqtt" : "^1.0.0"
  }
  </pre>


   https://github.com/Losant/losant-mqtt-js

### Losant Data Explorer #

   Their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.losant.com/blog/introducing-the-data-explorer">
   Data Explorer</a> is good for learning simple visual statistical inference
   without the complex setup and costs of industrial systems.

   Despite its low cost, Lorant offers sophisticated implementations of features not offered by some of its bigger competitors:
   recipies of devices to save time, 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.losant.com/getting-started/walkthrough/">virtual devices</a>, 
   device tags, 
   and device attributes.

   Lorant partners with Microsoft.

### Losant Social media #

   <a target="_blank" href="https://forums.losant.com/">
   User forums</a> can go for days with activity because the offering is still young.

   "What is Losant" Podcast on iTunes</a>
   says their front-end is built on React with Node backend software
   running in Google Compute Engine (but not Google services).
   They switched from MongoDB to
   <a target="_blank" href="https://influxdata.com/">
   InfluxDB</a> for time-series data.

## Adafruit.io #

Below are instructions for 
<a target="_blank" href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-io-basics-feeds">
creating a feed</a>

0. Register for an account at io.adafruit.com.
0. In the Welcome Dashboard, you can drag the "Try Me" slider to a value of your choosing.
0. Click MY DASHBOARDS, Your Feeds. CREATE FEED.
0. PROTIP: Since you'll have many devices, name the feed with the brand and 
   serial number of the device, such as:

   * rpi-d85fdaa0-cpu-temp
   * rpi-d85fdaa0-room-temp

0. Click CREATE FEED.
0. Optionally, click to change licensing and public/private visibility,
   which is ironic considering the AIO key is part of the query string,
   making it totally vulnerable to interception.
0. Click VIEW AIO KEYS. Highlight it and copy it to save it in a file
   along with the feed ID.
0. Construct a REST API call:
   <pre>
https://io.adafruit.com/api/groups/weather/send.json?x-aio-key=cda65ef7542e42d18aafcdd3d2ed4688&temperature=13&humidity=12&wind=45
   </pre>

   The response is 

0. The website provides docs for Node, Python, Ruby.
