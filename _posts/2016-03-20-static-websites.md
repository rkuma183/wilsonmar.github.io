## Static is Cool Now #

Here is why building a static site is now "cool" (popular, interesting, etc.).

When someone types in a URL on a web browser and
lands on a website built using WordPress, Drupal, or
other CMS (Content Management System), that user <strong>waits</strong> while
the web server make calls to a database and builds the HTML to send back.

Static sites are <strong>faster</strong> for several reasons.

1. There is no time lost <strong>generating HTML dynamically</strong>.
   There is no time lost calling a database.
   The web page sent to a visitor is direct response to the URL requested.
   
   Personalization is done by JavaScript running on the user's machine,
   calling web services APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).

2. The HTML file can be <strong>spread out</strong> around the world in a CDN 
   (Content Distribution Network) such as Amazon S3.
   This reduces network latency.

   Reduction in cost of CDNs via Amazon S3, CloudFlair, Fastly, etc.
   vs. the enterprise Akamai makes this possible.

   Due to less processing, the website is also more scalable,
   able to handle a much larger number of visitors.

## "JAM" Stack #

Static sites are called "JAM stack" for

   * JavaScript,
   * <a href="#APICalls">API calls</a> (to various 3rd party sites rather than local databases), and
   * Markup text stored in GitHub then built into HTML and stored in CDN.
   <br /><br />

<a target="_blank" href="https://jamstack.org/">jamstack.org</a>
comments on the drivers for the JAM stack:

   "Today browsers are the operating system of the web, and are able to run complex applications completely client side. They are capable of consuming and interacting with an ever growing amount of APIs and services across domains and infrastructures. CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) have gone from being a luxury only large corporations could afford, to being the natural way to cut down the time to first byte for sites and apps of all sizes. Deployment models have shifted from cumbersome manual uploads to automated processes triggered by ever-present version control systems."

<a name="APICalls"></a>

## API Calls #

The rise of APIs has removed many of the limitations
of static HTML:

   * Discourse for visitor comments
   * Lunr.js for search
   * Stripe for e-commerce


## The downside #

0. Some feel git version control is a hassle to use.

0. Some prefer the WSIWYG editors like Microsoft Word
over text editors and writing markdown code.

   However, <a target="_blank" href="https://cloudcannon.com/"> CloudCannon.com</a>
   enables users to create a Jekyll site that presents
   Visual Editor forms for editing text in context of background graphics.

0. Since Jekyll and other static platforms are newer than WordPress, Drupal, etc.
   there are not as much of a diversity in themes and plug-ins available.


## Tools to generate static websites #

I've configured a few, but most recently:

   * <strong>[Jekyll](/jekyll-site-development)</strong> is the most popular among static website generation tools largely because GitHub.io websites are
   hosted automatically, and free, from repositories in GitHub.com.

   Much like what wordpress.org provides, but
   with the git version control added -- a crucial feature.

Surveys are:

   * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.staticgen.com/">staticgen.com</a>
   presents its list in a gallery.

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://staticapps.org/">staticapps.org</a>

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://staticsitegenerators.net/">staticsitegenerators.net</a>
   presents an exhaustive list.

## <a name="ReactDriven"> React-driven generation of SPA pages</a> #

<a target="_blank" href="https://phenomic.io/">https://phenomic.io</a>,
   generates html from .md files containing yaml like Jekyll,
   but instead of template code, it processes standard templating in
   React.js with Webpack does the generation.

   Coding JavaScript in ES6 
   is possible because Babel or PostCSS or CSSNext enables
   can translate the ES6 code back to ES5 so that current websites work.

   * ESLint for JavaScript and 
   * Stylelint for CSS

Phenomic_app is rather young.
Its <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Phenomic_app">@Phenomic_app on Twitter</a>
had 130 followers as of July 6, 2016.

   Its advantage is that it generates SPA (Singe Page App) JavaScript
   which initially loads just enough to display on the page
   (so it's faster than loading the whole HTML file).
   More importantly, additional pages are downloaded as needed
   in response to user action such as scrolling.

   When a link or a button is clicked by a visitor,
   JavaScript running on the page updates the address bar, 
   but the whole web page is not refreshed. 
   Management of the address bar is done by the <strong>router</strong> JavaScript library.

   Use of React means changes to markup is instantly reflected on the web page display.

   There are several router libraries in the React ecosystem.
   The most popular router is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rackt/react-router">

0. Use npm to download phenomic into present working directory:

   <tt><strong>
   npm i phenomic
   </strong></tt>

   ? Twitter nickname (eg: MoOx, optional) 
   ? Do you want a CNAME file (eg: for GitHub Pages)? No
   Generated package.json file
   Copied boilerplate
   Setup done. Now run "npm install" to get started
   </pre>

   These can be changed later by editing the package.json file.

0. Install npm

   <tt><strong>

   </strong></tt>

0. Start npm:

   <tt><strong>
   npm start --devPort=3001

   </pre>

0. Edit the configuration file (subsituting vim with atom, subl, or other text editor):

   <tt><strong>
