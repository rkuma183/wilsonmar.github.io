This is a hands-on tutorial on how to create
Dockerfile and docker-compose files
that contain commands controlling how Docker instantiates containers across several operating systems.

Some refrences:

   * https://deis.com/blog/2015/dockerfile-instructions-syntax/

   * https://runnable.com/docker/java/dockerize-your-java-application

A Docker image is a read-only template used to create and launch a Docker container.

## Dockerize apps #

"Dockerizing" an application is the process of converting an application to run within a Docker container
and creating the Dockerfile for it.

Let's begin with an example.

0. Navigate to the folder containing a Dockerfile.

   NOTE: Creating the Dockerfile is called "dockerizing" a folder.

0. View the Dockerfile:

    <tt><strong>
    cat Dockerfile
    </strong></tt>

    Alternately, you may prefer to open the file using a text editor or IDE.

    There are only a handful of instructions in a Dockerfile.

    <pre>
FROM node:0.10.44-slim
&nbsp;
ADD . /home/demo/box/
&nbsp;
RUN cd /home/demo/box && npm install
&nbsp;
ENTRYPOINT ["/home/demo/box/boot.sh"]
   </pre>

   <a href="#VerifyInstall">Skip to see this built</a>.

   ### Docker builder instructions #
   
   \# ("pound sign") begins a comments line or a directive.

   * FROM sets the image to an operating system image. For options, do a 
   <a href="#DockerSearch">. This must be the first line.
   docker search</a>.
   * MAINTAINER defines the file's author
   * USER
   * ARG user1=someuser # referenced by --build-arg user=what_user in docker build
   * ARG CONT_IMG_VER 
   * ENV CONT_IMG_VER ${CONT_IMG_VER:-v1.0.0}
   * ENV foo /bar
   * ENV def=$abc
   * WORKDIR ${foo}    # sets working directory to /bar
   * VOLUME /tmp
   * ADD . $foo        # add . /bar to file system
   * COPY \$foo /quux 

   * HEALTHCHECK--interval=5m --timeout=3s \<br />
     CMD curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1
   * CMD ["--port 27017"] # provides defaults to executing container
   * CMD ["/usr/bin/wc","--help"] # executable and parameter
   * EXPOSE 27017 # sets the port to listen

   * RUN bash -c 'touch /app.jar' # updates the repository sources list, etc.
   * ENTRYPOINT ["top", "-b"] # sets default container commands
   * ONBUILD RUN /usr/local/bin/python-build --dir /app/src
   * STOPSIGNAL SIGKILL # sets the system call signal that will be sent to the container to exit.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/exec-form-entrypoint-example">
   This</a> Dockerfile shows use of the ENTRYPOINT to run Apache in the foreground (i.e., as PID 1):

   <pre>
FROM debian:stable
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --force-yes apache2
EXPOSE 80 443
VOLUME ["/var/www", "/var/log/apache2", "/etc/apache2"]
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/sbin/apache2ctl", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]
   </pre>

   An example for Java on WebLogic:

   <pre>
FROM kmandel/java:8
VOLUME /tmp
#ADD ${project.build.final}.jar app.jar
ADD my-api.jar app.jar
RUN bash -c 'touch /app.jar'
ENTRYPOINT ["java","<a target="_blank" href="http://www.thezonemanager.com/2015/07/whats-so-special-about-devurandom.html">-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom</a>","-jar","/app.jar"]
   </pre>

  After a Dockerfile is prepared, execute from command prompt to create the corresponding image:

  docker build . 

  Run docker run <em>image-name</em> to create a container out of the image to execute it.


### Dockerizing programming code #

   One of the advantages of using Docker is that an application can be deployed on several 
   operating systems.
   But different operating systems have different ways of specifying file paths such as:

   <tt>APP_CONFIG=/etc/dev.config</tt>

   Such files would contain API keys and flags to vary app behavior without requiring a re-deploy.

   PROTIP: Apps in Docker should be written in a way that references a file external to itself
   to obtain configuration data such as API keys.

   Contents in configuration files can be varied at run-time
   by a script that <strong>mounts different volumes</strong> containing the config file or
   by using a <strong>sed</strong> command which find a unique pattern in the file,
   then modifies the data.


### Common Logging #

   Also, rather than writing event information to a custom database,
   "cloud native" application programming code print to STDOUT/STDERR.
   This ensures application logs have a common format
   so that logs from other apps and monitoring utilities can all be co-mingled
   in a central logging system for historical analysis together by timeline.

   Logs can be acessed directly with the 
   `docker logs` command and by Docker API calls. 

   To simplify the dockerization process, some use 
   <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/jwilder/dockerize/">
   the Dockerize utility</a> Jason Wilder wrote in Golang
   and describes <a target="_blank" href="http://jasonwilder.com/blog/2014/10/13/a-simple-way-to-dockerize-applications/">
   here</a>. It works by wrapping calls to apps using the ENTRYPOINT or CMD directives.


### .dockerignore #

   The .dockerignore file is like a .gitignore file,
   but specifies items for Docker to ignore in the Dockerfile.

   See https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/dockerignore-file

### Mount

   mount a local path and map it to a path within the container 

   ~/Source/projecta:/usr/src/app


<a name="DockerCompose"></a>

## Docker Compose #

Docker compose creates multiple containers with a single operation. 

See https://docs.docker.com/compose/

An example <strong>docker-compose-dev.yml</strong> file from 
<a target="_blank" href="https://sloppy.io/from-dev-to-prod-with-nodejs-and-hackathon-starter-using-docker-compose-part-1/">
here</a>:

   <pre>
version: '2'
services:
&nbsp;
  web:
    image: node:6.1
    volumes:
      - ./:/usr/src/app
    working_dir: /usr/src/app
    command: sh -c 'npm install; npm install -g nodemon ; nodemon -e js,jade app.js'
    ports:
      - "80:3000"
    depends_on:
      - mongo
    networks:
      - all
    environment:
      MONGODB_URI: "mongodb://mongo:27017/hackathon"
&nbsp;
  mongo:
    image: mongo:3
    command: mongod --smallfiles
    networks:
      - all
&nbsp;
networks:
  all:
   </pre>

0. Define attributes of Docker host in environment variables:

   * DOCKER_HOST
   * DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY
   * DOCKER_CERT_PATH

See https://docs.docker.com/v1.11/compose/compose-file/
