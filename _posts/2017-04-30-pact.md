<i>{{ page.excerpt }}</i>

Pact (at https://docs.pact.io/) is a testing library of consumer driven contracts (CDC) useful for creating and executing integration tests on microservices
to guarantee that Test Doubles are always a valid stand-in for the real service.

A Contract is a collection of agreements between a client (Consumer) and an API (Provider) that describes the interactions that can take place between them.

Consumer Driven Contracts is a pattern for software development that drives the development of the Provider from its Consumers' point of view.

Martin Fowler <a target="_blank" href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html">on Consumer Driven Contracts: A Service Evolution Pattern</a>.

Pact is a word (not an acronym) for 
a family of frameworks to verify whether Consumer Driven Contracts are actually satisfied by the collaborating services built.

NOTE</a>: Pact splits integration tests into separate unit tests.

Beth Skurrie (@bethesque, Melbourne, Victoria) uses her experience on
https://github.com/realestate-com-au/pact to explain
in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/pact"> this [26:37] video on Sep 04, 2015 at [9:32]</a> "Pact mocks the provider when it the consumer makes calls and handles responses correctly. [9:45] While consumer tests are running, the interactions is recorded into a Pact file as a contract. That file is then used to interact with the real provider to ensure "test symmetry" that mock and real providers work the same way.

Mocks are also called test doubles that stand in for the real service.

The process also supports the inverse scenario.

## Sample Results


## Install server

Pact is available in multiple languages (Java, Scala, Groovy, Ruby, .NET, Swift, JS and Golang).


## Setup



## Sample Pact exchange

PROTIP: Contracts are readable by software.

[11:04] Arrange, Pact, and Assert

   <pre>
Pact.service_consumer "Zoo App" do
  has_pact_with "Animal Service" do
    mock_service :animal_service do
      port 1234
    end
  end
end
   </pre>

Contract types:

* Preconditions ("You must be this tall to ride")
* Postconditions (e=mc^2)
* Variants

## Version

Combinatorial: 3 classses x 4 code paths each (4 * 4 * 4) = 64 tests

Changing a published API over time is hard due to backward compatibility concerns. This is even more of an issue in a microservice architecture with 100's of microservices that each publish an API. 

Consumer Driven Contracts is an effective service evolution pattern. 
when implemented in Spring Cloud Contract.
