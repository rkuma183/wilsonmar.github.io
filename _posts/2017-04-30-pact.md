Pact is a word (not an acronym) for a family of software <strong>testing code frameworks</strong> (at <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pact.io/">https://docs.pact.io</a>) to verify whether "Consumer Driven Contract" (CDC) definitions are actually satisfied by the collaborating services built. 

All the steps below is summarized and animated by <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hFqEg7zs9N6V04xNT3vzdreCE_F5tuEd">a PowerPoint file</a>

1. <a target="_blank" href="https://dius.com.au/2016/10/19/scaling-organisations-with-microservices-and-contract-testing/">
NOTE</a>: The genius behind Pact is it tests the integration of a Consumer and Provider by separating tests into two unit testing phases. Because only one component is being tested at a time, failures are easier to identify.

2. Pact enables <strong>"Consumer Driven"</strong> testing in that it begins with testing the codebase from the Consumers' point of view. Martin Fowler's colleague Ian Robinson of Thoughtworks <a target="_blank" href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html">describes Consumer Driven Contracts: A Service Evolution Pattern</a>. Since that 2006 article, the industry has advanced beyond Schemas and XML to JSON format. But the process is still useful.
  
3. A reference to import or include the Pact framework are added to the top of unit test code. Pact functions and methods have been <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pact-foundation/README">implemented in multiple programming languages</a> (through several organizations):

   JVM Pact: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DiUS/pact-jvm">https://github.com/DiUS/pact-jvm</a>

   * https://github.com/DiUS/pact-jvm/tree/master/pact-jvm-consumer-java8
   makes use of Lambda DSL.
   <br /><br />

   Pact.js: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js">https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js</a> which uses Mocha:

   <pre>
   const chai = require('chai')
   const pact = require('pact')
   </pre>

   Pact Go: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go">https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go</a>
   
   Pact Python: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-python">https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-python</a>

   Ruby Pact: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-ruby">https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-ruby</a> which began at https://github.com/realestate-com-au/

   <pre>
   let Pact = require('pact')
   </pre>

   Pact Swift: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DiUS/pact-consumer-swift">https://github.com/DiUS/pact-consumer-swift</a>
   
   .Net C# Pact: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SEEK-Jobs/pact-net">https://github.com/SEEK-Jobs/pact-net</a>


   This means a consumer service can be written in JavaScript while the Provider service is written in Java.

   These frameworks implement the Pact specification (in JSON) defined by the Pact Foundation at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-specification">https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-specification</a>.

   ![pact-mock-diagram-650x234-40214](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/32980312-41552f7c-cc21-11e7-8f69-a4f92e052384.jpg)

4. After code for a service is written and compiled, test code is run.

5. The `pact.setup()` command creates a <strong>mock service Provider</strong> with which the Consumer code communicates. This means the Provider service does not need to be built in order for Consumer work to begin.

6. `pact.addInteraction()` objects register an expectation on the Mock Server called by test case(s). This causes HTTP requests to be issued.

7. ??? includes a <strong>state</strong> the provider should be in:

   <pre>
   given: "happy 123"
   </pre>

8. If successful, the Pact framework automatically <strong>records</strong> interactions between a Consumer the mock Provider into JSON-formatted files called conract or pact files such as <a href="#SampleContract">this</a>.

9. The framework then uses the contract file in a <strong>replay</strong> to the Provider in
"Pact Provider tests".

10. The `pact.verify()` command then verifies that all and only the <strong>interactions</strong> specified occurred and that they match. This is called after any other assertions and once per test case. The `pact.verify()` command implicitly calls the `removeInteractions` to clear out expectations of the Mock Service for the next test run.

11. `pact.finalize()` records the interactions registered to the Mock Server into the pact file and shuts it down.

12. The Provider runs verification tests against a real (live) version of its service, using the shared pact file. This testing determines whether Test Doubles (mocks) of microservices are a valid stand-in for the real service. 

13. The contracts are stored either a) committed to a shared Git repo; b) uploaded to a shared file storage; or c) stored by the Pact Broker application.

14. Pact Broker software can format <strong>reports</strong> about pacts in its store.

15. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/pact">[15:30]</a> Because the Pact Broker handles the traffic, it can automatically generate a <a href="#NetworkDiagram">Network Diagram</a> of relationships between services (who calls whom).

    The Contract Testing above ensures that pact file representing Consumer requests are compatible with how the Provider codebase handles those requests.

16. Pact commands can be get pacts to run against either the Consumer or Provider.

   ### Versioning Backward Compatibility

   When contracts are committed (or otherwise saved) into a source repository, the event is recognized by an event hook which kicks off a Jenkins job invoking the Pact server.

   When known-compatible versions of Consumer and Provider goes into Production 
   <em>together at the same time</em>, 
   the Provider codebase (how it actually works) has already been tested 
   as being compatible with pact files representing requests made by Consumers in Production.
   
   But because Consumer and Provider are not always updated together at the same time,
   a legacy version in the Provider may not be compatible with a Consumer pact's most recent version, which Git automatically labels as the latest <strong>"HEAD"</strong>.

   New changes in the Provider codebase may break compatibility with Consumers in production.

   These situations are <a target="_blank" title="(Beth Skurrie blog posted December 5, 2014)" href="http://rea.tech/enter-the-pact-matrix-or-how-to-decouple-the-release-cycles-of-your-microservices/">
   illustrated</a> using this "Pact Matrix": 

   <table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
   <tr align="left"><th> Versions: </th><th> Consumer HEAD pact
   </th><th> Consumer Prod pact </th></tr>
   <tr valign="top"><td> Provider HEAD codebase </td><td> a) Contract tests first green-field release </td><td> c) Contract tests to ensure <strong>provider</strong> is backwards compatible </td></tr>
   <tr valign="top"><td> Provider<br />Prod<br />codebase </td><td> d) Contract tests to ensure <strong>consumer</strong> is backwards compatible </td><td> b) <em>Already tested</em> when released together </td></tr>
   </table>

   So, to detect compatibility issues from disconnected versions:

17. Recent changes in Consumer pacts should be tested against production Provider code.

18. Recent changes to the Provider codebase should be tested against pacts for the Consumer in production.

   ### Postel's Law

   Postel's Law, also called Robustness Principle, says be <strong>strict</strong> in  requests sent out, but interpretation of responses should be <strong>loose</strong> (liberal or be accomodating) such as by allowing (not rejecting) extra keys unused by some consumers. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KrCQPR2I4s">This</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B4KjAhQJoQ">this</a> video uses the example of internet browsers being forgiving of HTML errors.

### Network Diagram

## Competitors

Pact eliminates the need for integration tests and thus a separate set of servers for the integration environment.

   * Pact takes the place of structured serialization formats such as protobuf, thrift, or messagepack. 

   * Spring Cloud Contract is a competitor to Pact. See <a target="_blank" alt="presented in Toronto Jan 27, 2017" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyNzYOcuU4I"> this video</a> by Adib Saikali. It is only Java.
   <br /><br />

Tests generated from Swagger (now OpenAPI) specifications are complimentary to Pact because they focus on whether servers can handle various HTTP response codes and data types defined in the spec. This is done by <a target="_blank" href="https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/swagger-mock-validator">Atlassian's swagger-mock-validator</a> command line tool which confirms whether mock request and responses conform to the schema specified in a swagger specification (<a target="_blank" href="https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/swagger-mock-validator/src/936ec5b265eacea66d131548d4c32dbe0e232501/RULES.md?fileviewer=file-view-default">rules defined</a>). Its command format is:

<pre>
swagger-mock-validator <em>/path/to/</em>swagger.json \
   https://<em>pact-broker</em> \
   --provider <em>my-provider-name</em>
</pre>


<a name="SampleContract"></a>

## Sample Contract

A Consumer Driven Contract (aka pact) is a JSON-formatted file that contains a collection of agreements between a client (Consumer) and an API (Provider) that describes the <strong>interactions</strong> that can take place between them.

{% highlight JSON %}
{
  "consumer": {
    "name": "billy"
  },
  "provider": {
    "name": "bobby"
  },
  "interactions": [
    {
      "description": "My test",
      "providerState": "User billy exists",
      "request": {
        "method": "POST",
        "path": "/users/login",
        "headers": {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
        "body": {
          "username":"billy",
          "password":"issilly"
        }
      },
      "response": {
        "status": 200,
      }
    },
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "pactSpecification": {
      "version": "2.0.0"
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The above is from https://codefresh.io/blog/how-to-test-microservice-integration-with-pact/

There have been several versions of the Pact format (1.0, 1.1, 2.0).

If a pact such as the above is stored in a Pact Broker service, pasting the pact URL into a browser would return a formatted presentation of the pact generated.


## Test separately

<!-- bskurrie@dius.com.au -->
Beth Skurrie (@bethesque, of Melbourne, Victoria and https://github.com/realestate-com-au/pact ) explains in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/pact"> a [26:37] video on Sep 04, 2015</a> at [9:32] says "Pact mocks the provider when it the consumer makes calls and handles responses correctly. [9:45] While consumer tests are running, the interactions is recorded into a Pact file as a contract. That file is then used to interact with the real provider to ensure <strong>"test symmetry"</strong> that mock and real providers work the same way.

The process also supports the inverse scenario.

Combinatorial: 3 classses x 4 code paths each (4 * 4 * 4) = 64 tests

[20:03] Docker



## Pact Broker Install

There are several ways

### Dockerized

1. Use the sample Docker Compose setup at:

   https://github.com/DiUS/pact_broker-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml

2. Modify the docker-compose.yml file as required.

   For a quick start with the Pact Broker and Postgres, we have an 
    
   Run docker-compose up to get a running Pact Broker and a clean Postgres database

   Now you can access your local broker:

3. Get IP of your running Docker instance

   <pre>
DOCKER_HOST=$(docker-machine ip $(docker-machine active))
curl -v http://$DOCKER_HOST # you can visit in your browser too!
   </pre>

NOTE: this image should be modified before using in Production, in particular, the use of hard-coded credentials


A) Use Terraform on AWS

   Alternately, instantiate instances on AWS using
   https://github.com/nadnerb/terraform-pact-broker

C) Create a Google Insta



### Custom Docker image

Alternately, one sample Dockerfile to bring up Pact-Js within Docker,

   <pre>
FROM ubuntu:16.04
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y   default-jre   default-jdk   git curl
RUN apt-get update
RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_7.x | bash -
RUN apt-get install -y nodejs
RUN npm -v
RUN node -v
RUN apt-get update
RUN curl -sL  https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | bash -
RUN apt-get install -y nodejs
RUN npm -v && node -v
RUN git clone https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js.git
RUN cd pact-js && npm install ; exit 0
RUN cd pact-js/examples/e2e && npm install
RUN cd pact-js/examples/e2e && npm run test:consumer
RUN cd pact-js/examples/e2e && npm run test:publish
RUN cd pact-js/examples/e2e && npm run test:provider
   </pre>

If you want to test your own app, substitue `pact-js/examples/e2e` with your own app.



1. Install Docker
2. Instantiate a Postgress database.
3. Look at https://github.com/DiUS/pact_broker-docker
4. Instantiate a container using the Docker image at 

   https://hub.docker.com/r/dius/pact-broker/tags/

   <pre><strong>
    docker pull dius/pact-broker
   </strong></pre>

5. Start Docker image:

   <pre><strong>
   docker run -d -p 80:80 pact-broker
   </strong></pre>

0. Re-run


## Jenkins

   <pre>
pipeline {
    agent none 
    stages {
        stage('Example Build') {
            agent { docker "rest-test" } 
            steps {
                sh 'ls -ltr'
            }
        }
       
    }
}
   </pre>

## Sample Pact exchange

First of all, if the consumer assumes the API would be based on posting a JSON document (being invoked from a web browser), make sure that the provider is not implemented using an `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` POST API.

Development of the interaction starts from the consumer side, with a test that at first fails until code is written to make the test pass (TDD here).

This contract is then provided to the Provider team to implement the provider service to fulfill the contract.

PROTIP: Contracts are readable by both people and software.

[11:04] Arrange, Pact, and Assert

This DSL from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-specification/tree/master/implementation-guidelines">Guidelines</a>:

   <pre>
Pact.service_consumer "Zoo App" do
  has_pact_with "Animal Service" do
    mock_service :animal_service do
      port 1234
    end
  end
end
   </pre>


https://gist.github.com/bethesque/9d81f21d6f77650811f4
You will need ruby or the standalone mock service to run these examples.

   gem install pact-mock_service

   pact-mock-service help start
