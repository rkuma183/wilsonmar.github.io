<i>{{ page.excerpt }}</i>

Pact is a word (not an acronym) for a family of software testing code frameworks (at <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pact.io/">https://docs.pact.io</a>) to verify whether "Consumer Driven Contracts" (CDCs) definitions are actually satisfied by the collaborating services built. 

It's called "Consumer Driven" because Pact test framework and server software enables a development process that drives the development of service Providers from its consumers' point of view. Martin Fowler's colleague Ian Robinson of Thoughtworks <a target="_blank" href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html">describes Consumer Driven Contracts: A Service Evolution Pattern</a>. Since that 2006 article, the industry has advanced beyond Schemas and XML to JSON format. But the process is still useful.
  

## Workflow

<a target="_blank" href="https://dius.com.au/2016/10/19/scaling-organisations-with-microservices-and-contract-testing/">
NOTE</a>: The genius behind Pact is that it splits integration testing into separate unit tests.
The advantage of this approach is that because only one component is being tested at a time, failures are easier to identify.

![pact-flow-650x372-59032](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/32995797-e445896e-cd36-11e7-9af7-fbf8c5d02f8a.jpg)
<small>[<a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hFqEg7zs9N6V04xNT3vzdreCE_F5tuEd">.pptx</a>]</small>

1. A reference to import or include the Pact framework are added to the top of test code. Pact functions and methods have been <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pact-foundation/README">implemented in multiple programming languages</a> (through several organizations):

   JVM Pact: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DiUS/pact-jvm">https://github.com/DiUS/pact-jvm</a>

   * https://github.com/DiUS/pact-jvm/tree/master/pact-jvm-consumer-java8
   makes use of Lambda DSL.
   <br /><br />

   Pact.js: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js">https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js</a> which uses Mocha:

   <pre>
   const chai = require('chai')
   const pact = require('pact')
   </pre>

   Pact Go: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go">https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go</a>
   
   Pact Python: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-python">https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-python</a>

   Ruby Pact: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/realestate-com-au/pact">https://github.com/realestate-com-au/pact</a>

   <pre>
   let Pact = require('pact')
   </pre>

   Pact Swift: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DiUS/pact-consumer-swift">https://github.com/DiUS/pact-consumer-swift</a>
   
   .Net C# Pact: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SEEK-Jobs/pact-net">https://github.com/SEEK-Jobs/pact-net</a>


   This means a consumer service can be written in JavaScript while the Provider service is written in Java.

   These frameworks implement the Pact specification (in JSON) defined by the Pact Foundation at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-specification">https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-specification</a>.

   ![pact-mock-diagram-650x234-40214](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/32980312-41552f7c-cc21-11e7-8f69-a4f92e052384.jpg)

2. When code is committed into a source repository, it is recognized by an event hook which kicks off a Jenkins job invoking the Pact server.

3. Pact creates and spins up a provider <strong>stub</strong> against which the test executes.

   The `pact.setup()` command is what starts the mock server within the test code.

4. Test code interact with a Provider:

   `pact.addInteraction()` objects register an expectation on the Mock Server called by your test case(s). 

5. This includes a <strong>state</strong> the provider should be in:

   <pre>
   given: "happy 123"
   </pre>

6. Interactions are validated and written to a pact (contract) if successful.

7. `pact.verify()` verifies that all and only the interactions specified occurred and that they match. This is called after any other assertions and once per test case. 

   The `pact.verify()` command implicitly calls the `removeInteractions` to clear out expectations of the Mock Service for the next test run.

8. `pact.finalize()` records the interactions registered to the Mock Server into the pact file and shuts it down.

9. The output of Pact Consumer runs is one or more json files such as <a href="#SampleContract">this</a>.

10. These contracts (also called "pacts") are either a) committed to a shared Git repo; b) uploaded to a shared file storage; or c) stored by the Pact Broker application.

11. Pact files are used in "Pact Provider tests" to make requests by consumers to the Provider service. Pact testing is useful to determine whether Test Doubles (mocks) of microservices are a valid stand-in for the real service. 

12. The Provider runs its own verification tests against a real-life version of its service, using the shared pact file.

13. Consumer software makes API calls to live Provider services.

   ### Versioning Backward Compatibility

   The Contract Testing above ensures that pact file representing Consumer requests
   are compatible with how the Provider codebase handles those requests.

   When compatible versions of Consumer and Provider goes into Production 
   <em>together at the same time</em>, 
   the Provider codebase (how it actually works) has already been tested 
   as being compatible with pact files representing requests made by Consumers in Production.
   
   But because Consumer and Provider are not always updated together at the same time,
   a legacy version in the Provider may not be compatible with a Consumer pact's most recent version, which Git automatically labels as "HEAD".

   And visa versa.
   Recent changes in Provider behavior may break compatibility with Consumers in production.

   These situations are <a target="_blank" title="(Beth Skurrie blog posted December 5, 2014)" href="http://rea.tech/enter-the-pact-matrix-or-how-to-decouple-the-release-cycles-of-your-microservices/">
   illustrated</a> using this "Pact Matrix": 

   <table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
   <tr align="left"><th> Version: </th><th> Consumer HEAD (pact) 
   </th><th> Consumer Prod (pact) </th></tr>
   <tr valign="top"><td> Provider HEAD (codebase) </td><td> Contract tests </td><td> Contract tests to ensure <strong>provider</strong> is backwards compatible </td></tr>
   <tr valign="top"><td> Provider<br />Prod<br />(codebase) </td><td> Contract tests to ensure <strong>consumer</strong> is backwards compatible </td><td> <em>Already tested</em> </td></tr>
   </table>

   So, to detect compatibility issues:

14. Recent changes in Consumer pact should be tested against production Provider code.

15. Recent changes to the Provider codebase should be tested against pacts for the Consumer in production.


## Pastel's Law

[15:09] "Pastel's Law" -- be <strong>strict</strong> in what is sent out, but responses should be <strong>loose</strong> to allow extra keys for different consumers.


## Competitors

Pact eliminates the need for integration tests and thus a separate set of servers for the integration environment.

   * Pact takes the place of structured serialization formats such as protobuf, thrift, or messagepack. 

   * Spring Cloud Contract is a competitor to Pact. See <a target="_blank" alt="presented in Toronto Jan 27, 2017" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyNzYOcuU4I"> this video</a> by Adib Saikali. It is only Java.
   <br /><br />

Tests generated from Swagger (now OpenAPI) specifications are complimentary to Pact because they focus on whether servers can handle various HTTP response codes and data types defined in the spec. This is done by <a target="_blank" href="https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/swagger-mock-validator">Atlassian's swagger-mock-validator</a> command line tool which confirms whether mock request and responses conform to the schema specified in a swagger specification (<a target="_blank" href="https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/swagger-mock-validator/src/936ec5b265eacea66d131548d4c32dbe0e232501/RULES.md?fileviewer=file-view-default">rules defined</a>). Its command format is:

<pre>
swagger-mock-validator <em>/path/to/</em>swagger.json \
   https://<em>pact-broker</em> \
   --provider <em>my-provider-name</em>
</pre>


<a name="SampleContract"></a>

## Sample Contract

A Consumer Driven Contract (aka pact) is a JSON-formatted file that contains a collection of agreements between a client (Consumer) and an API (Provider) that describes the <strong>interactions</strong> that can take place between them.

{% highlight JSON %}
{
  "consumer": {
    "name": "billy"
  },
  "provider": {
    "name": "bobby"
  },
  "interactions": [
    {
      "description": "My test",
      "providerState": "User billy exists",
      "request": {
        "method": "POST",
        "path": "/users/login",
        "headers": {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
        "body": {
          "username":"billy",
          "password":"issilly"
        }
      },
      "response": {
        "status": 200,
      }
    },
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "pactSpecification": {
      "version": "2.0.0"
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The above is from https://codefresh.io/blog/how-to-test-microservice-integration-with-pact/

There have been several versions of the Pact format (1.0, 1.1, 2.0).

If a pact such as the above is stored in a Pact Broker service, pasting the pact URL into a browser would return a formatted presentation of the pact generated.


## Test separately

<!-- bskurrie@dius.com.au -->
Beth Skurrie (@bethesque, of Melbourne, Victoria and https://github.com/realestate-com-au/pact ) explains in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/pact"> a [26:37] video on Sep 04, 2015</a> at [9:32] says "Pact mocks the provider when it the consumer makes calls and handles responses correctly. [9:45] While consumer tests are running, the interactions is recorded into a Pact file as a contract. That file is then used to interact with the real provider to ensure <strong>"test symmetry"</strong> that mock and real providers work the same way.

The process also supports the inverse scenario.

Combinatorial: 3 classses x 4 code paths each (4 * 4 * 4) = 64 tests

### Network Graph from Broker

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/pact">[15:30]</a> 
Because the Pact Broker knows about traffic,
like Google, the Pact Broker can mine the data, to automatically generate a graph of relationships between services (who calls whom).

![pact-network-graph-654x513.jpg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/32830073-eab9168a-c9a8-11e7-9e76-b2cd0208dd8b.jpg)


## Pact Broker Install

There are several ways.

### Dockerized

Use the sample Docker Compose setup at:

   https://github.com/DiUS/pact_broker-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml

1. Modify the docker-compose.yml file as required.

For a quick start with the Pact Broker and Postgres, we have an 

    
        Run docker-compose up to get a running Pact Broker and a clean Postgres database

Now you can access your local broker:

# Get IP of your running Docker instance
DOCKER_HOST=$(docker-machine ip $(docker-machine active))
curl -v http://$DOCKER_HOST # you can visit in your browser too!

NOTE: this image should be modified before using in Production, in particular, the use of hard-coded credentials

1. Install Docker
2. Instantiate a Postgress database.
3. Look at https://github.com/DiUS/pact_broker-docker
4. Instantiate a container using the Docker image at https://hub.docker.com/r/dius/pact-broker/tags/

   <pre><strong>
    docker pull dius/pact-broker
   </strong></pre>

5. Start Docker image:

   <pre><strong>
   docker run -d -p 80:80 pact-broker
   </strong></pre>

0. Re-run

Alternately, instantiate instances on AWS using
https://github.com/nadnerb/terraform-pact-broker


## Sample Pact exchange

First of all, if the consumer assumes the API would be based on posting a JSON document (being invoked from a web browser), make sure that the provider is not implemented using an `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` POST API.

Development of the interaction starts from the consumer side, with a test that at first fails until code is written to make the test pass (TDD here).

This contract is then provided to the Provider team to implement the provider service to fulfill the contract.

PROTIP: Contracts are readable by both people and software.

[11:04] Arrange, Pact, and Assert

This DSL from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-specification/tree/master/implementation-guidelines">Guidelines</a>:

   <pre>
Pact.service_consumer "Zoo App" do
  has_pact_with "Animal Service" do
    mock_service :animal_service do
      port 1234
    end
  end
end
   </pre>


https://gist.github.com/bethesque/9d81f21d6f77650811f4
You will need ruby or the standalone mock service to run these examples.

   gem install pact-mock_service

   pact-mock-service help start
