Here is a <strong>hands-on</strong> introduction to learn the Google Compute Platform (GCP) and getting certified as a Google Certified Professional (GCP).

Concepts are introduced succintly after you take a small action, followed by succinct commentary, with links to more information.


## Free $300 account for 60 days

In US regions, new accounts get $300 of overage for 12 months.

   PROTIP: Create several emails, each with a different credit card.

   Google Cloud Platform free trial ends after 60 days or when your $300 in credits are used up.

   Throughout, <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/always-free-usage-limits">
   Google does not charge for a low level of usage</a>:

   * No more that 8 cores at once across all instances
   * No more than 100 GB of solid state disk (SSD) space
   * Max. 2TB (2,000 GB) total persistent standard disk space
   <br /><br />

   Google bills in minute-level increments (with a 10-minute minimum charge),
   unlike Amazon which charges by the hour.

1. In Chrome or Firefox browser, get a Gmail address.
2. Go to the free trial page:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://console.developers.google.com/freetrial">
   https://console.developers.google.com/freetrial</a>

   Alternately, go to Google Cloud's marketing home page at:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/">
   https://cloud.google.com</a>

0. Click the Try It Free button. Complete the registration. Click Agree and continue. Start my new trial.

0. Configure at <a target="_blank" href="https://console.cloud.google.com/">
   console.cloud.google.com</a>

0. PROTIP: Bookmark this URL.

   PROTIP: Google remembers your last project and its region, and gives them to you even if you do not specify them in the URL.

   CAUTION: Your bill can suddenly jump up to thousands of dollars a day, with no explanation.
   Configure to put limits.

## Google Certified Professional (GCP) Certification Exams

https://cloud.google.com/certification/
Google has three certifications, each 2 hour $200 exam is taken in-person at a
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.kryteriononline.com/Locate-Test-Center">
kryterion Test Center</a>.

As of December, 2016, Google pared down exam materials to 3 exams:

1. Google Certified Professional - <a href="#CloudArchitect">Cloud Architect</a>
2. Google Certified Professional - <a href="#DataEngineer">Data Engineer</a> (for big data)
3. Google Certified Associate - G Suite Administrator (Gmail, Google Drive, etc.)

NOTE: There is no "Associate" level, unlike Amazon.

## Why Google Cloud?

As with other clouds:

* "Pay as you go" rather than significant up-front purchase, which eats time
* No software to install (and go stale)
* Google scale - 9 cloud regions in 27 zones. 90 Edge cache

But Google has the fastest fibre network, enabling high performance across the world.


## GCP Console / Dashboard

<a target="_blank" href="https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard">
https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard</a><br />
displays panes for your project from among the list obtained by clicking the "hamburger" menu icon at the upper left corner.
The major sections of this menu are:

* <a href="#COMPUTE">COMPUTE</a> (App Engine, Compute Engine, Container Engine)
* <a href="#STORAGE">STORAGE</a> (Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Datastore, Storage, Cloud SQL, Spanner)
* <a href="#NETWORKING">NETWORKING</a> (VPC)
* <a href="#STACKDRIVER">STACKDRIVER</a> (Monitoring, Debug, Trace, Logging, Error Reporting)

* <a href="#BIGDATA">BIG DATA</a> (BigQuery, Pub/Sub, Dataproc, Dataflow, ML Engine, Genomics, IoT Core, Dataprep)


## New Project

Project Name (aka "Friendly Name")

Project ID is unique among all other projects at Google and cannot be changed.

The "cp100" project is a demo project available to all accounts.

<strong>Service accounts</strong> are automatically created for each project:

   <em>project_number</em>@developer.gserviceaccount.com<br />
   <em>project_id</em>@developer.gserviceaccount.com


## Permissions

The two types of IAM roles on GCP are primitive and predefined.
Primitive roles (Owner, Editor, Viewer, Billing Administrator).

With GCP's hierarchical format, the parent policy always overrules a child policy.

<a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#predefined_roles">
Roles</a> (such as compute.instanceAdmin) are a collection of permissions to give access to a given resource, in the form:

   <em>service</em>.<em>resource</em>.<em>verb</em><br />
   compute.instances.delete

Owner, Editor, Viewer


## Google CLIs

Google has three shells:

   <a href="#gcloudcli">gcloud CLI</a>

   * SQL Server Enterprise
   <br /><br />

API Explorer site: GCEssentials_ConsoleTour

Authentication using OAuth2 (JWT), JSON.



<a name="NETWORKING"></a>

## Google NETWORKING

Google creates all instances with a private (internal) IP address such as 10.142.3.2.

One public IP (such as 35.185.115.31) is optionally created to a resource.
The IP can be ephemeral (from a pool) or static (reserved).
Unassigned static IPs cost $.01 per hour (24 cents per day).

Connect vis VPN using IPsec to encrypt traffic.

Google Cloud Router supports dynamic routing between Google Cloud Platform and corporate networks

HTTP Load Balancing ensures only healthy instances handle traffic across regions.

Google Cloud Interconnect:

   * Carrier Interconnect - Enterprise-grade connections provided by carrier service providers
   * Direct Peering - connect business directly to Google
   * CDN Interconnect - CDN providers link with Google's edge network
   <br /><br />

The <strong>engines</strong> of GCP:

* <a href="#GCE">Compute Engine</a> - full control of VMs for Linux and Windows Server. The API controls addresses, autoscalars, backend, disks, firewalls, global Forwarding, health, images, instances, projects, region, snapshots, ssl, subnetworks, targets, vpn, zone, etc.

* <a href="#GCF">Google Cloud Functions - serverless platform for single-purpose microservices written in JavaScript executed in Node.js when triggered by events

* <a href="#GAE">App Engine</a> - deploy code for Google to scale

* <a href="#GKE">Container Engine</a> - OSS Kubernetes-based container clustering



<a name="GCE"></a>

### Google Compute Engine

GCE offers the most <strong>control</strong> but also the most work (operational overhead).

Preemptible instances are cheaper but can be taken anytime, like Amazon's.

Google provides load balancers, VPNs, firewalls.

Use GCE where you need to select the size of disks, memory, CPU types 

* use GPUs (Graphic Processing Units)
* custom OS kernels
* specifically <strong>licensed</strong> software
* protocols beyond HTTP/S
* orchestration of multiple containers
<br /><br />

GCE is called a IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) offering of <strong>instances</strong>, 
NOT using Kubernetes automatically like GKC. Use it to migrate on-premise solutions to cloud.

### GKE (Google Container Engine)

<a target="_blank" href="https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/">
<img align="right" alt="gce-console-menu-244x241-11754" width="244" height="241" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/31014930-a8b77274-a4da-11e7-921f-5ff139a5e527.jpg"></a>

The "K" is there because GKE is powered by [Kubernetes](/kubernetes/), Google's container orchestration manager, providing compute services above Google Compute Engine (GCE). "Kubernetes" is in the URL to the GKE home page:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/">
   https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes</a>

1. Begin in "APIs & Services" because Services provide a single point of access (load balancer IP address and port) to specific pods.
0. Click ENABLE...
0. Search for Container Engine API and click it. 
0. In the gshell: `gcloud compute zones list`

Workloads are defined by the number of Compute Engine worker <strong>nodes</strong>.

The cluster of nodes are controlled by a <strong>K8 master</strong>.

<strong>Pods</strong> are a group of containers within a node which share IP addresses, hostname, and other resources. Pods abstact network and storage of container for easy movement. Pods have short lifespans -- deleted and recreated as necessary.

Podes are replicated across several Compute Engine nodes.

![kubernetes-pods-599x298-35069](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/31013696-81d30fc0-a4d4-11e7-9852-36be55b74499.jpg)

<a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com./container-engine/docs/replicationcontrollers/">
replication controller</a> automatically add or remove pods to ensure that the specified number of pod replicas are running across nodes.
This makes GKE "self healing" to provide high availability and reliability with
"autoscaling" up and down based on demand.


   #### Create container cluster

0. Select Zone
0. Set "Size" (vCPUs) from 3 to 2 -- the number of <strong>nodes</strong> in the cluster.

   Nodes are the primary resource that runs services on Google Container Engine.

0. Click More to expand.
0. Add a Label.

   The size of boot disk, memory, and storage requirements can be adjusted later.

0. Instead of clicking "Create", click the "command" link for the equivalent the gcloud CLI commands in the pop-up.

   <pre>
gcloud beta container --project "mindful-marking-178415" clusters create "cluster-1" --zone "us-central1-a" --username="admin" --cluster-version "1.7.5-gke.1" --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-type "COS" --disk-size "100" --scopes "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.write","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/monitoring.write","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/servicecontrol","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/service.management.readonly","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/trace.append" --num-nodes "2" --network "default" --no-enable-cloud-logging --no-enable-cloud-monitoring --subnetwork "default" --enable-legacy-authorization
   </pre>

   Alternately,

   <pre><strong>

  --scopes "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email","cloud-platform" \
  --num-nodes 2
   </strong></pre>

   The response sample (widen window to see it all):

0. Check status of pods

   kubectl get pods

0. Retrieve IP address:

   kubectl get services bookshelf-frontend


   <a name="DestroyCluster"></a>

   #### Destroy cluster

   It may seem a bit premature at this point, but since Google charges by the minute, it's better you know how to do this earlier than later. Return to this later if you don't want to continue.

0. Using the key information from the previous command:

   <tt><strongh>
    gcloud container clusters delete cluster-1 --zone us-central1-a
   </strong></tt>


   #### 2). View cloned source code for changes

0. Use a text editor (vim or nano) to define a .yml file to define what is in pods.

0. Build Docker

   <tt><strong>docker build -t gcr.io/...
   </strong></tt>

   gcloud config set container/cluster ...

3). Cloud Shell instance - Reove code placeholds
