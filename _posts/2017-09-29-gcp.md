Here is a <strong>hands-on</strong> introduction to learn the Google Compute Platform (GCP) and getting certified as a Google Certified Professional (GCP).

Concepts are introduced succintly after you take a small action, followed by succinct commentary, with links to more information.


## Free $300 account for 60 days

In US regions, new accounts get $300 of overage for 12 months.

   PROTIP: Create several emails, each with a different credit card.

   Google Cloud Platform free trial ends after 60 days or when your $300 in credits are used up.

1. In Chrome or Firefox browser, get a Gmail address.
2. Go to the free trial page:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://console.developers.google.com/freetrial">
   https://console.developers.google.com/freetrial</a>

   Alternately, go to Google Cloud's marketing home page at:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/">
   https://cloud.google.com</a>

0. Click the Try It Free button. Complete the registration. Click Agree and continue. Start my new trial.

0. Configure at <a target="_blank" href="https://console.cloud.google.com/">
   console.cloud.google.com</a>

0. PROTIP: Bookmark this URL.

   PROTIP: Google remembers your last project and its region, and gives them to you even if you do not specify them in the URL.

<a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/always-free-usage-limits">
Google does not charge for a low level of usage</a>:

   * No more that 8 cores at once across all instances
   * No more than 100 GB of solid state disk (SSD) space
   * 2TB persistent standard disk space

   CAUTION: Your bill can suddenly jump up to thousands of dollars a day, with no explanation.
   Configure to put limits.

   Google bills in minute-level increments (with a 10-minute minimum charge),
   unlike Amazon which charges by the hour.



## Google Certified Professional (GCP) Certification Exams

https://cloud.google.com/certification/
Google has three certifications, each 2 hour $200 exam is taken in-person at a
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.kryteriononline.com/Locate-Test-Center">
kryterion Test Center</a>.

As of December, 2016, Google pared down exam materials to 3 exams:

1. Google Certified Professional - <a href="#CloudArchitect">Cloud Architect</a>
2. Google Certified Professional - <a href="#DataEngineer">Data Engineer</a> (for big data)
3. Google Certified Associate - G Suite Administrator (Gmail, Google Drive, etc.)

NOTE: There is no "Associate" level, unlike Amazon.

## Why Google Cloud?

As with other clouds:

* "Pay as you go" rather than significant up-front purchase, which eats time
* No software to install (and go stale)
* Google scale - 9 cloud regions in 27 zones. 90 Edge cache

But Google has the fastest fibre network, enabling high performance across the world.


## GCP Console / Dashboard

<a target="_blank" href="https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard">
https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard</a><br />
displays panes for your project from among the list obtained by clicking the "hamburger" menu icon at the upper left corner.
The major sections of this menu are:

* <a href="#COMPUTE">COMPUTE</a> (App Engine, Compute Engine, Container Engine)
* <a href="#STORAGE">STORAGE</a> (Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Datastore, Storage, Cloud SQL, Spanner)
* <a href="#NETWORKING">NETWORKING</a> (VPC)
* <a href="#STACKDRIVER">STACKDRIVER</a> (Monitoring, Debug, Trace, Logging, Error Reporting)
* <a href="#TOOLS">TOOLS</a> (Container Registry, Source Repositories, Deployment Manager, Endpoints)
* <a href="#BIGDATA">BIG DATA</a> (BigQuery, Pub/Sub, Dataproc, Dataflow, ML Engine, Genoics, IoT Core, Dataprep)


## New Project

Project Name (aka "Friendly Name")

Project ID is unique among all other projects at Google and cannot be changed.

The "cp100" project is a demo project available to all accounts.

<strong>Service accounts</strong> are automatically created for each project:

   <em>project_number</em>@developer.gserviceaccount.com<br />
   <em>project_id</em>@developer.gserviceaccount.com


## Permissions

The two types of IAM roles on GCP are primitive and predefined.
Primitive roles (Owner, Editor, Viewer, Billing Administrator).

With GCP's hierarchical format, the parent policy always overrules a child policy.

<a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#predefined_roles">
Roles</a> (such as compute.instanceAdmin) are a collection of permissions to give access to a given resource, in the form:

   <em>service</em>.<em>resource</em>.<em>verb</em><br />
   compute.instances.delete

Owner, Editor, Viewer


## Google CLIs

Google has three shells:

   <a href="#gcloudcli">gcloud CLI</a>

The <strong>engines</strong> of GCP:

* <a href="#GCE">Compute Engine</a> - full control of VMs for Linux and Windows Server. The API controls addresses, autoscalars, backend, disks, firewalls, global Forwarding, health, images, instances, projects, region, snapshots, ssl, subnetworks, targets, vpn, zone, etc.

* <a href="#GCF">Google Cloud Functions - serverless platform for single-purpose microservices written in JavaScript executed in Node.js when triggered by events

* <a href="#GAE">App Engine</a> - deploy code for Google to scale

* <a href="#GKE">Container Engine</a> - OSS Kubernetes-based container clustering



<a name="GCE"></a>

### Google Compute Engine

GCE offers the most <strong>control</strong> but also the most work (operational overhead).

Preemptible instances are cheaper but can be taken anytime, like Amazon's.

Google provides load balancers, VPNs, firewalls.

Use GCE where you need to select the size of disks, memory, CPU types 

* use GPUs (Graphic Processing Units)
* custom OS kernels
* specifically <strong>licensed</strong> software
* protocols beyond HTTP/S
* orchestration of multiple containers
<br /><br />

GCE is called a IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) offering of <strong>instances</strong>, NOT using Kubernetes. Use it to migrate on-premise solutions to cloud.


https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/?hl=en_US&_ga=2.131668815.-1771618146.1506638659


<a name="GKE"></a>

### GKE (Google Container Engine)

<a target="_blank" href="https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/">
<img align="right" alt="gce-console-menu-244x241-11754" width="244" height="241" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/31014930-a8b77274-a4da-11e7-921f-5ff139a5e527.jpg"></a>

The "K" is there because it's powered by [Kubernetes](/kubernetes/), Google's container orchestration manager, providing compute services above Google Compute Engine (GCE). "Kubernetes" is the URL to GKE:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/">
   https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes</a>

1. Begin in "APIs & Services" because Services provide a single point of access (load balancer IP address and port) to specific pods.
0. Click ENABLE...
0. Search for Container Engine API and click it. 
0. In the gshell: `gcloud compute zones list`

Workloads are defined by the number of Compute Engine worker <strong>nodes</strong>.

The cluster of nodes are controlled by a <strong>K8 master</strong>.

<strong>Pods</strong> are a group of containers within a node which share IP addresses, hostname, and other resources. Pods abstact network and storage of container for easy movement. Pods have short lifespans -- deleted and recreated as necessary.

Podes are replicated across several Compute Engine nodes.

![kubernetes-pods-599x298-35069](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/31013696-81d30fc0-a4d4-11e7-9852-36be55b74499.jpg)

<a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com./container-engine/docs/replicationcontrollers/">
replication controller</a> automatically add or remove pods to ensure that the specified number of pod replicas are running across nodes.
This makes GKE "self healing" to provide high availability and reliability with
"autoscaling" up and down based on demand.


   #### Create container cluster

0. Select Zone
0. Set "Size" (vCPUs) from 3 to 2 -- the number of <strong>nodes</strong> in the cluster.

   Nodes are the primary resource that runs services on Google Container Engine.

0. Click More to expand.
0. Add a Label.

   The size of boot disk, memory, and storage requirements can be adjusted later.

0. Instead of clicking "Create", click the "command" link for the equivalent the gcloud CLI commands in the pop-up.

   <pre>
gcloud beta container --project "mindful-marking-178415" clusters create "cluster-1" --zone "us-central1-a" --username="admin" --cluster-version "1.7.5-gke.1" --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-type "COS" --disk-size "100" --scopes "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.write","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/monitoring.write","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/servicecontrol","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/service.management.readonly","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/trace.append" --num-nodes "2" --network "default" --no-enable-cloud-logging --no-enable-cloud-monitoring --subnetwork "default" --enable-legacy-authorization
   </pre>

   Alternately,

   <pre><strong>
gcloud container clusters create bookshelf \
  --scopes "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email","cloud-platform" \
  --num-nodes 2
   </strong></pre>

   The response sample (widen window to see it all):
