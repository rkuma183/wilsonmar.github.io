Here is a <strong>hands-on</strong> introduction to learn the Google Compute Platform (GCP) and getting certified as a Google Certified Professional (GCP).

Concepts are introduced after you take a small action, followed by succinct commentary, with links to more information.


## Free $300 for 60 days

Google Cloud Platform free trial ends after 60 days or when your $300 in credits are used up.

1. Go to <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/">
   https://cloud.google.com</a>.
2. Click the Try It Free button.
3. Configure at <a target="_blank" href="https://console.cloud.google.com/">
   console.cloud.google.com</a>

4. PROTIP: Bookmark this URL.

   PROTIP: Google remembers your last project and its region, and gives them to you even if you do not specify them in the URL.

In US regions, new accounts get $300 of overage for 12 months.

   PROTIP: Create several emails, each with a different credit card.

<a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/always-free-usage-limits">
Google does not charge for a low level of usage</a>:

   * No more that 8 cores at once across all instances
   * No more than 100 GB of solid state disk (SSD) space
   * 2TB persistent standard disk space

<a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/free/">
https://cloud.google.com/free</a>

CAUTION: Your bill can suddenly jump up to thousands of dollars a day, with no explanation.
Configure to put limits.

Google bills in minute-level increments (with a 10-minute minimum charge),
unlike Amazon which charges by the hour.



## Google Certified Professional (GCP) Certification Exams

https://cloud.google.com/certification/
Google has three certifications, each 2 hour $200 exam is taken in-person at a
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.kryteriononline.com/Locate-Test-Center">
kryterion Test Center</a>.

As of December, 2016, Google pared down exam materials to 3 exams:

1. Google Certified Professional - Cloud Architect
2. Google Certified Professional - Data Engineer (for big data)
3. Google Certified Associate - G Suite Administrator (Gmail, Google Drive, etc.)

NOTE: There is no "Associate" level, unlike Amazon.

See https://cloud.google.com/training

## Why Google Cloud?

As with other clouds:

* "Pay as you go" rather than significant up-front purchase, which eats time
* No software to install (and go stale)
* Google scale - 9 cloud regions in 27 zones. 90 Edge cache

But Google has the fastest fibre network, enabling high performance across the world.


## Console / Dashboard

<a target="_blank" href="https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard">
https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard</a><br />
displays panes for your project from among the list obtained by clicking the "hamburger" menu icon at the upper left corner.
The major sections of this menu are:

* COMPUTE
* STORAGE
* NETWORKING
* STACKDRIVER
* TOOLS
* BIG DATA

Another view are the <strong>engines</strong> of GCP:

* <a href="#GCE">Compute Engine</a> - full control of VMs for Linux and Windows Server. The API controls addresses, autoscalars, backend, disks, firewalls, global Forwarding, health, images, instances, projects, region, snapshots, ssl, subnetworks, targets, vpn, zone, etc.

* <a href="#GCF">Google Cloud Functions - serverless platform for event-based microservices

* <a href="#GAE">App Engine</a> - deploy code for Google to scale

* <a href="#GKE">Container Engine</a> - OSS Kubernetes-based container clustering


## New Project

Project Name (aka "Friendly Name")

Project ID is unique among all other projects at Google and cannot be changed.

## Google CLIs

Google has three shells:

   <a href="#gcloud">gcloud CLI</a>

   gsutil to access Cloud Storage

   bq for Big Query tasks

https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart-windows
Google Cloud SDK for Windows (gcloud)

## Local Docker Image

Install from

   https://cloud.google.com/sdk



## Permissions

The two types of IAM roles on GCP are primitive and predefined.

With GCP's hierarchical format, the parent policy always overrules a child policy.

Applications run based on a <strong>service account</strong> rather than your user account.

   <em>project_number</em>@developer.gserviceaccount.com<br />
   <em>project_id</em>@developer.gserviceaccount.com

<a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#predefined_roles">
Roles</a> (such as compute.instanceAdmin) are a collection of permissions to give access to a given resource, in the form:

   <em>service</em>.<em>resource</em>.<em>verb</em><br />
   compute.instances.delete

Owner, Editor, Viewer


## Cloud storage classes

* Multi-regional
* Regional
* Nearline
* Coldline


BigQuery


<a name="Stackdriver"></a>

## Stackdriver for Logging

GCP's tool for logging and monitoring is "Stackdriver".


## Google Cloud Services

![gcloud-offerings-600x120-48k](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/29748808-c13564d6-8aeb-11e7-8415-a265b34e9997.jpg)

From the left, highly controlled by you to highly managed by Google on the right.

<a name="GCE"></a>

### Google Compute Engine

GCE is a IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) offering of <strong>instances</strong>.
where you select the size of disks, memory, CPU types
for <strong>licensed</strong> software.

GCE offers the most control but also the most work (operational overhead).

Google provides load balancers, VPNs, firewalls.

https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/?hl=en_US&_ga=2.131668815.-1771618146.1506638659


<a name="GKE"></a>

### GKE (Google Container Engine)

The "K" is there because it's powered by Kubernetes to manage containers.

Kubernetes is Google's container orchestration manager

Separates apps from operating systems.

   The primary resource that runs services on Google Container Engine
   is a <strong>node</strong>.


<a name="GAE"></a>

### Google App Engine

GAE is a PaaS (Platform as a Service) offering 
where Google manages application infrastucture (Jetty 8, Servlet 3.1, .Net Core, NodeJs)
that responds to <strong>HTTP requests</strong>.

Develop in Java, Python, Go, PHP

https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs?hl=en_US&_ga=2.237246272.-1771618146.1506638659


<a name="GCF"></a>

### Google Cloud Functions

Here, single-purpose <strong>functions</strong> are coded in JavaScript and executed in <strong>NodeJs</strong>
when triggered by <strong>events</strong> occuring, such as a file upload.

Google provides a "Serverless" environment 
for building and connecting cloud services on a web browser.


<a name="GFirebase"></a>

### Google Firebase

Handles HTTP requests on mobile devices.
